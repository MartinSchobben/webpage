I am a research fellow at the University of Leeds. Recently, I started a postdoctoral research project, under the title: A PHase-Specific geochemical study of marine PRoductivity and nutrient cycling during the end-Permian mass extinction (PHoSPhoR), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinshaft (DFG).
