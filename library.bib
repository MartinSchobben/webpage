abstract = {Assemblages of acritarchs, prasinophytes, and miospores were recovered from the uppermost Iquiri and lower portion of the Itacua formations in southeast Bolivia. Analysis of the diverse and somewhat abundant well-preserved palynomorph assemblage indicates a Late Devonian (late Famennian) age for both formations, and further subdivision in ascending stratigraphic order into the ?VCo, LL, LE, and LN miospore biozones of Western Europe. The presence of age-diagnostic miospore taxa from South America and North America indicates contemporaneous glaciation events between these two regions. The results from close sampling of the diamictite facies of the Itacua Formation at the Bermejo West section, Bolivia, correlate the latest Famennian spore inceptions used to define the Euramerica miospore biozone sequence (LL, LE, and LN zones). The Itacua Formation diamictite sequence examined is relatively thin compared to other diamictite sequences in Bolivia. Furthermore, the miospore biozones represent an estimated duration of three million years, whereas orbitally-forced glacial-interglacial events (e.g., Ruddiman, 2001) are of the Milankovitch frequency range of between 20,000 and 400,000. years. Therefore, it seems most likely that a number of glacial/interglacial events are represented, rather than a single glacial episode. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope ratios of well-preserved brachiopod calcite and conodont apatite were used to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Middle and Late Devonian. By assuming an oxygen isotopic composition of –1permil V-SMOW for Devonian seawater, the oxygen isotope values of Eifelian and early Givetian brachiopods and conodonts give average palaeotemperatures ranging from 22 to 25 °C. Late Givetian and Frasnian palaeotemperatures calculated from delta18O values of conodont apatite are close to 25 °C in the early Frasnian and increase to 32 °C in the latest Frasnian and early Famennian. Oxygen isotope ratios of late Givetian and Frasnian brachiopods are significantly lower than equilibrium values calculated from conodont apatite delta18O values and give unrealistically warm temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 °C. Diagenetic recrystallization of shell calcite, different habitats of conodonts and brachiopods, as well as non-equilibrium fractionation processes during the precipitation of brachiopod calcite cannot explain the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite. Moreover, the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite with respect to equilibrium delta18O values calculated from conodont apatite is too large to be explained by a change in seawater pH that might have influenced the oxygen isotopic composition of brachiopod calcite. The realistic palaeotemperatures derived from delta18O apatite may suggest that biogenic apatite records the oxygen isotopic composition and palaeotemperature of Palaeozoic oceans more faithfully than brachiopod calcite, and do not support the hypothesis that the 18O /16O ratio of Devonian seawater was significantly different from that of the modern ocean.},

@article{Gruszczynski2003a,
abstract = {The new dataset of the carbon and oxygen stable isotope values across the sedimentary sequence of the Changhsingian Stage at Meishan, south China documents the carbon biogeochemical cycle in detail. The cycle began with storage of organic carbon (Corg), mainly as biogenic carbon dioxide in clathrates, and carbon dioxide from anaeorobic methane oxidation (AMO) in the stratified sea water masses, which is reflected by a rapid increase in the $\delta$13C values. Storage of Corg demanded a large biomass productivity, and thus consumption of a vast amount of carbon dioxide, which would have been associated with climatic oceanic water cooling. Oceanic water cooling and enhanced volcanism is actually reflected by a gradual increase in the $\delta$18O values. The longterm stasis between Corg burial and reburial was then achieved, as reflected by the stable course of the $\delta$13C curve. At the same time, cool water circulation caused a continuous increase in the $\delta$18O values. At the end of the cycle, several factors including earthquakes and other tectonic movements marking the onset of major Siberian volcanism, together with a local temperature increase resulted in a change of ocean circulation, caused mixing of stratified sea water masses. This was followed by destruction of the existing clathrates, degassing of carbon dioxide, oxidation of organic matter, and a rapid decrease in the oceanic $\delta$13C values. Apart from the carbon dioxide that was released to the atmosphere, part of the methane must have been oxidised, creating additional carbon dioxide as well as water vapour. The carbon dioxide and water vapour must have initiated a greenhouse effect and caused thermal stratification of seawater which, in turn, initiated reconstruction of the redox in the Early Triassic. The end of the cycle was associated with the end-Permian mass extinction. The global warming associated with methane release from clathrates led to collapse of terrestrial plants. At the same time, the mixing event brought methane and organic matter for oxidation, which caused massive consumption of oxygen and extinction of the terrestrial fauna. In the marine environment, the mixing event brought water masses rich in carbon dioxide, as well as excess hydrogen ions from anoxic zones, onto shelf areas, causing a collapse of marine biota. The carbon biogeochemical cycle of the Changhsingian indicated by the initial rapid rise, long-term stasis, and final rapid drop in $\delta$13C values, seems to be a rule for a pattern of Phanerozoic $\delta$13C values in sedimentary carbonates. This suggests that a process of methane storage and release may have had a bearing on major geochemical perturbations throughout Earth history. However, methane storage, with or without the association of carbon dioxide and other forms of Corg, and its subsequent release, could have occurred in many different scenarios throughout the Phanerozoic, Therefore, the end of the carbon cycles may be associated with mass extinction only when release of methane is coupled with other phenomena, which is the case with the end-Permian event.},

@article{Korte2010a,
abstract = {The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition is marked by distinct perturbations in the global carbon cycle resulting in a prominent negative carbon-isotope excursion at the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary, well known from a plethora of marine and continental sediments. Potential causes for this negative delta(13)C trend (and their links to the latest Permian mass extinction) have been intensively debated in the literature. In order to draw conclusions regarding causation, a general delta(13)C curve was defined after consideration of all available datasets and with due reference to the biostratigraphic background. The most important features of the P-T carbon-isotope trend are the following: the 4-7 parts per thousand delta(13)C decline (lasting similar to 500,000 years) is gradual and began in the Changhsingian at the stratigraphic level of the C. bachmanni Zone. The decreasing trend is interrupted by a short-term positive event that starts at about the latest Permian low-latitude marine main extinction event horizon (=EH), indicating that the extinction itself cannot have caused the negative carbon-isotope excursion. After this short-term positive excursion, the delta(13)C decline continues to a first minimum at about the P-T boundary. A subsequent slight increase is followed by a second (occasionally two-peaked) minimum in the lower (and middle) I. isarcica Zone. The negative carbon-isotope excursion was most likely a consequence of a combination of different causes that may include: (1) direct and indirect effects of the Siberian Trap and contemporaneous volcanism and (2) anoxic deep waters occasionally reaching very shallow sea levels. A sudden release of isotopically light methane from oceanic sediment piles or permafrost soils as a source for the negative carbon-isotope trend is questionable at least for the time span a little below the EH and somewhat above the P-T boundary.

Most of them are delineated by conformable or submarine erosion surfaces, and well controlled by conodont and fusulinid zones. Four important sea-level falls are recognized in the area, which occur respectively at the basal Sweetognathodus whitei zone, lower S.aff. hanzhongensis zone, middle Jinogondolella xuanhanensis zone and the basal Clarkina yini zone. Among the recognized transgression events, three are regarded as the most significant. They occur respectively at the basal Neogondolella exculptus zone, basal Jinogondolella nankingensis zone and the lower Clarkina postbitteri zone, and are all accompanied by faunal turnovers.

abstract = {Palynomorph distribution in Euramerica and western Gondwana, from the Latest Givetian to the Latest Famennian, may be explained, to some extent, by climatic changes. Detailed miospore stratigraphy dates accurately the successive steps of these changes. Interpretation is built on three postulates which are discussed: Euramerica at slightly lower latitudes than generally accepted by most paleomagnetic reconstructions: a conodont time-scale accepted as the most used available subdivision of time; and Late Devonian sea-level fluctuations mainly governed by glacio-eustasy. The Frasnian-Famennian timescale is also evaluated. The comparison, based on conodont correlations, between Givetian and most of the Frasnian miospore assemblages from, respectively, northern and southern Euramerica demonstrates a high taxonomic diversity in the equatorial belt and much difference between supposed equatorial and (sub) tropical vegetations. On the contrary, a similar vegetation pattern and therefore probably compatible climatic conditions were present from tropical to subpolar areas. A rather hot climate culminated during the Latest Frasnian when equatorial miospore assemblages reached their maximum width. The miospore diversity shows also a rather clear global Late Frasnian minimum which is also recorded during the Early and Middle Famennian but only in low latitude regions while, in high latitude, very cold climates without perennial snow may explain the scarcity of miospores and so of vegetation. The Early and Middle Famennian conspicuous latitudinal gradient of the vegetation seems to attenuate towards the Late and Latest Famennian but this might be above all the result of the development, of cosmopolitan coastal lowland vegetations (downstream swamps) depending more on the moisture and equable local microclimates than on the probably adverse climates of distant hinterland areas. During than time, periods of cold climate without perennial snow cover and with rare vegetation may have alternated with less cold but wetter climates, thus giving rise to the development of mountain glaciers in high latitudes and explaining the jerking character of the global major marine regression. In high latitude regions, the development of an ice cap reaching sea level is only recorded by the end of the Latest Famennian, immediately below the DCB but even if glacial evidence are not known at near the FFB, a short (0.1 Ma?) glaciation seems the best reasonable explanation of the major eustatic fall following the Kellwasser Event. The sudden growth and decay of a hypothetical. Earliest Famennian ice sheet can be explained by the reduction and later, increase in greenhouse capacity of the atmosphere. These changes in the atmospheric CO2 might have provoked changes in the mode of ocean-atmosphere operation. It may also be partly controlled by a volcanic paroxysm and/or bolide impacts. The Hony microtektites represent the best known evidence of the impact of extraterrestrial bodies on Earth corresponding to the UKW and they are immediately followed by a regression suggested by the quantitative analysis of acritarch assemblages. In the paleo-tropical Late Famennian a peat-forming vascular plant community occurs for the first time and makes possible quantitative palynology of autochthonous sediments allowing the recognition of different swamp and near-swamp characteristic miospores. The early Latest Famennian starts with a widespread transgression which could correspond to the melting phases of the hypothetical Late Famennian mountain glaciers. During the end-Famennian the coastal lowland vegetation has a worldwide distribution from sub-polar to equatorial regions. The climate has become less cold in high latitudes but wetter than before probably because the midlatitude cyclonic activity allows sufficient polar transportation of moisture to form large snow cover. Extensive coastal glaciers developed in different Bolivian and Brazilian basins, well dated by miospores. Rapid climatic changes characterize the onset of glaciation. The cyclic nature of climate allowed even intertropical marine faunas to reach occasionally the subpolar regions. For the plant kingdom, the crisis which follows the Hangenberg Event was more severe than the Late Frasnian Crisis. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pyrite framboid diameter analysis and organic geochemistry of the triangularis/crepida boundary section at Kowala (Holy Cross Mountains, Poland) imply suboxic to oxic and sporadically euxinic bottom waters during the Lower Famennian. In addition, morphological web-like structures typical for microbial mats, as well as the recognition of 2{\^{I}}±-methylhopanes and monomethyl-alkane cyanobacteria biomarkers is evidenced of microbial activity after the global Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) extinction event. The presence of cyanobacterial mats also suggests suboxic to oxic environments and at the same time photic bottom water conditions. However, isorenieratane and its derivatives were detected in almost all samples. The presence of this well-known biomarker of green sulfur bacteria implies that euxinic conditions were present in the upper part of the water column at least intermittently or that temporal euxinia occurred in the water column. Presence of euxinic conditions is confirmed by the occurrence of small-sized pyrite framboids which were particularly dominant in the lower part of the section. The shift towards low $\delta$13C values in both micritic limestones and in sedimentary organic matter seen at the beginning of the period of diminished photic zone, might reflect an influx of newly respired CO2 to surface waters, caused by enhanced respiration at depth after the F/F transition in the Ch{\"{A}}™ciny-Zbrza basin.},

abstract = {Profiles of carbon isotopes were studied in marine limestones of Late Permian and Early Triassic age of the Tethyan region from 20 sections in Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Armenian SSR, Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and China. The Upper Permian sections continue the high positive values of delta13C previously found in Upper Permian basins in NW Europe and western USA. In the more complete sections of Tethys it can now be demonstrated that the values of delta13C drop from the Murgabian to the Dzhulfian Stages of the Upper Permian, then sharply to values near zero during the last two biozones of the Dorashamian. These levels of delta13C sample the Tethys Sea and the world ocean, and equal values from deep-water sediments at Salamis Greece indicate that they apply to the whole water column. We hypothesize that the high values of delta13C are a consequence of Late Paleozoic storage of organic carbon, and that the declines represent an episodic cessation of this organic deposition, and partial oxidation of the organic reservoir, extending over a period of several million years. The carbon isotope profile may reflect parallel complexity in the pattern of mass extinction in Late Permian time.},

abstract = {Late Devonian glaciation is well-documented in three Brazilian basins, and newer work has shown a wider extent for this event, reaching Bolivia, Peru, Central African Republic, Niger, and the USA. Physical evidence for this event includes glacial pavements and polymict striated, and faceted clasts as dropstones and within marine resedimented deposits. Late Devonian (Frasnian? and Famennian) onset of Gondwanaland's glaciations resulted in fundamental changes in coeval and later (Mississippian) depositional systems worldwide. Palynomorphs date the more widespread event within the Retispora lepidophyta (miospore) palynozone, which often occurs with the marine acritarch Umbellasphaeridium saharicum. This initial glaciation continued into earliest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) time. There were several consequences from the short-term glacioeustasy. In North America, central Europe and southern China there is a coeval sea-level fall that exhumed and eroded carbonate platforms, deposited siliciclastics, and generated lacunae in the Famennian record. The lowstand resulted in extensive carbonate breccias, shallow-water deposits and evaporites in western U.S.A. Lowstand clastic wedges were deposited in a regression (eastern U.S.A.) with widespread black shales. In Moravia, Famennian siliciclastic influx increased as a result of subaerial weathering in newly-emergent highs that resulted from sea-level drop. Partial sea-level drops were also manifested by ferruginous oolites, which developed in nearshore environments and were subsequently dispersed down adjacent slopes by storm resedimentation. In southern China, aggradation, siliciclastic influx, reflux-dolomitization from evaporation, and shallow-water carbonate resulted from Famennian sea-level fall. The coupling of glacial and lowstand events explains the sudden appearance of shallow-marine, as well as subaerially-affected features after the Frasnian transgression that breached the North American craton. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition is characterized not only by the biggest Phanerozoic mass extinction, at the end of Permian, but also a prolonged period of recovery of the biota during the succeeding Early Triassic. The delayed recovery is generally attributed to the effects of extreme environmental conditions on the Early Triassic ecosystem. However, there has been very little study of the cause and mechanism of the environmental conditions that prevailed during the period of extinction and subsequent recovery. Research on the Permian-Triassic boundary and Lower Triassic, especially that on environmental events at the beginning of the Triassic in South China, indicates that the slowness of the recovery may be the result of three factors: (1) extreme environmental conditions that persisted through the transitional period and which were maintained by, for example, intermittent contemporary volcanism; (2) a passive evolutionary and ecologic strategy of the biota, in which r-selection taxa were dominant and K-selection forms insignificant; (3) an immature, poorly functioning ecosystem, which had difficulty in responding to and withstanding extreme environmental changes. According to data from South China, environmental changes were frequent during the Late Permian, and especially serious at the Permian-Triassic boundary. The Late Permian ecosystem was well structured and fully functioning as a result of a long period of steady development during the late Palaeozoic, and was capable of resisting general environmental changes. However, increasingly frequent and probably more extreme environmental events in the latest Permian may have led to a general collapse of this ecosystem and to the mass extinction at the end of the Permian. The Early Triassic ecosystem was immature, functioned poorly, and was unable to respond effectively to environmental changes, so that persisting extreme environmental conditions slowed ecosystem reconstruction considerably, and the recovery of the biota therefore took a relatively long time. The environmental events at the Permian-Triassic boundary might not be significantly different from those at other Phanerozoic transitions, but they consisted of a series of events that occurred at intervals during the transitional period. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Defining the transformations of phosphorus (P) in sediments is critical to assessing the geochemical behavior of sedimentary P and the behavior of reactive P (Preactive = Poxide-associated q- Pauthigenic q- Porganic) relative to organic carbon (Corganic). This study includes the determination of P components and Corganic concentrations on samples from sites in the California Current region (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP)leg 167, sites 1010, 1011, 1012, 1014, 1016, and 1021), in the Benguela Current region (ODP leg 175, sites 1082, 1084, and 1085), and on Blake Nose in the western Atlantic (ODP leg 17 lB, sites 1050 and 1052). Sample depths range up to 650 m, and ages range up to 65 Ma. Our data demonstrate the transformation of labile forms of P (Porganic and Poxide-associated) to Pauthigenic throughout the sediment column in all redox states and at all sedimentation rates investigated, until a substantial portion of reactive P is in the authigenic form ({\textgreater} 80{\%}). (C/P)organic ratios are always greater than or equal to the Redfield Ratio in all of the sediments we studied. Sediments with Corganic concentrations {\_}{\textless}2 wt {\%} have Corganic/Preactive ratios less than the Redfield Ratio, and Corganic/Preactive ratios increase linearly with Corganic, consistent with degradation of Corganic with age. In general, Corganic/Preactive ratios for sediments with Corganic concentrations {\_}{\textgreater}2 wt {\%}, from a variety of redox states and sedimentation rates, center around the Redfield Ratio, although some ratios are as high as 3 times the Redfield Ratio. However, Corganic/ Preactive ratios (up to 400) do not approach the high ratios observed for (C/P)organic ratios (up to 4500). Because of the efficient transfer of labile forms of P to Pauthigenic, Corganic/Preactive ratios better describe the geochemical behavior of sedimentary P},

abstract = {Palynomorph distribution in Euramerica and western Gondwana, from the Latest Givetian to the Latest Famennian, may be explained, to some extent, by climatic changes. Detailed miospore stratigraphy dates accurately the successive steps of these changes. Interpretation is built on three postulates which are discussed: Euramerica at slightly lower latitudes than generally accepted by most paleomagnetic reconstructions: a conodont time-scale accepted as the most used available subdivision of time; and Late Devonian sea-level fluctuations mainly governed by glacio-eustasy. The Frasnian-Famennian timescale is also evaluated. The comparison, based on conodont correlations, between Givetian and most of the Frasnian miospore assemblages from, respectively, northern and southern Euramerica demonstrates a high taxonomic diversity in the equatorial belt and much difference between supposed equatorial and (sub) tropical vegetations. On the contrary, a similar vegetation pattern and therefore probably compatible climatic conditions were present from tropical to subpolar areas. A rather hot climate culminated during the Latest Frasnian when equatorial miospore assemblages reached their maximum width. The miospore diversity shows also a rather clear global Late Frasnian minimum which is also recorded during the Early and Middle Famennian but only in low latitude regions while, in high latitude, very cold climates without perennial snow may explain the scarcity of miospores and so of vegetation. The Early and Middle Famennian conspicuous latitudinal gradient of the vegetation seems to attenuate towards the Late and Latest Famennian but this might be above all the result of the development, of cosmopolitan coastal lowland vegetations (downstream swamps) depending more on the moisture and equable local microclimates than on the probably adverse climates of distant hinterland areas. During than time, periods of cold climate without perennial snow cover and with rare vegetation may have alternated with less cold but wetter climates, thus giving rise to the development of mountain glaciers in high latitudes and explaining the jerking character of the global major marine regression. In high latitude regions, the development of an ice cap reaching sea level is only recorded by the end of the Latest Famennian, immediately below the DCB but even if glacial evidence are not known at near the FFB, a short (0.1 Ma?) glaciation seems the best reasonable explanation of the major eustatic fall following the Kellwasser Event. The sudden growth and decay of a hypothetical. Earliest Famennian ice sheet can be explained by the reduction and later, increase in greenhouse capacity of the atmosphere. These changes in the atmospheric CO2 might have provoked changes in the mode of ocean-atmosphere operation. It may also be partly controlled by a volcanic paroxysm and/or bolide impacts. The Hony microtektites represent the best known evidence of the impact of extraterrestrial bodies on Earth corresponding to the UKW and they are immediately followed by a regression suggested by the quantitative analysis of acritarch assemblages. In the paleo-tropical Late Famennian a peat-forming vascular plant community occurs for the first time and makes possible quantitative palynology of autochthonous sediments allowing the recognition of different swamp and near-swamp characteristic miospores. The early Latest Famennian starts with a widespread transgression which could correspond to the melting phases of the hypothetical Late Famennian mountain glaciers. During the end-Famennian the coastal lowland vegetation has a worldwide distribution from sub-polar to equatorial regions. The climate has become less cold in high latitudes but wetter than before probably because the midlatitude cyclonic activity allows sufficient polar transportation of moisture to form large snow cover. Extensive coastal glaciers developed in different Bolivian and Brazilian basins, well dated by miospores. Rapid climatic changes characterize the onset of glaciation. The cyclic nature of climate allowed even intertropical marine faunas to reach occasionally the subpolar regions. For the plant kingdom, the crisis which follows the Hangenberg Event was more severe than the Late Frasnian Crisis. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Permian magnetostratigraphic record demonstrates that a remarkable change in geomagnetism occurred in the Late Guadalupian (Middle Permian; ca. 265 Ma) from the long-term stable Kiaman Reverse Superchron (throughout the Late Carboniferous and Early-Middle Permian) to the Permian-Triassic Mixed Superchron with frequent polarity changes (in the Late Permian and Triassic). This unique episode called the Illawarra Reversal probably reflects a significant change in the geodynamo in the outer core of the planet after a 50 million years of stable geomagnetism. The Illawarra Reversal was likely led by the appearance of a thermal instability at the 2900 km-deep core-mantle boundary in connection with mantle superplume activity. The Illawarra Reversal and the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary event record the significant transition processes from the Paleozoic to Mesozoic-Modern world. One of the major global environmental changes in the Phanerozoic occurred almost simultaneously in the latest Guadalupian, as recorded in 1) mass extinction, 2) ocean redox change, 3) sharp isotopic excursions (C and Sr), 4) sea-level drop, and 5) plume-related volcanism. In addition to the claimed possible links between the above-listed environmental changes and mantle superplume activity, I propose here an extra explanation that a change in the core's geodynamo may have played an important role in determining the course of the Earth's surface climate and biotic extinction/evolution. When a superplume is launched from the core-mantle boundary, the resultant thermal instability makes the geodynamo's dipole of the outer core unstable, and lowers the geomagnetic intensity. Being modulated by the geo- and heliomagnetism, the galactic cosmic ray flux into the Earth's atmosphere changes with time. The more cosmic rays penetrate through the atmosphere, the more clouds develop to increase the albedo, thus enhancing cooling of the Earth's surface. The Illawarra Reversal, the Kamura cooling event, and other unique geologic phenomena in the Late Guadalupian are all concordantly explained as consequences of the superplume activity that initially triggered the breakup of Pangea. The secular change in cosmic radiation may explain not only the extinction-related global climatic changes in the end-Guadalupian but also the long-term global warming/cooling trend in Earth's history in terms of cloud coverage over the planet. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Data from five marine sections across the Permian-Triassic boundary in southern China reveal a pattern of 13C-depleted carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb) in different facies spanning carbonate platform to lower slope. A gradual decrease of $\delta$13Ccarb is evident in all sections and matched by an opposing change in 87Sr/86Sr from the Late Permian to the Induan (Early Triassic). These complementary trends in strontium and carbon isotope data imply an extended period of enhanced continental uplift and weathering of silicates and organic matter across the Permian-Triassic event boundary (PTEB). A pronounced sharp drop of $\delta$13Ccarb at the PTEB is most recognizable in the upper ramp environment of Meishan, occurs weakly in shallow water environments and cannot be discerned in the deepest water setting. We propose that this pattern reflects an enhancement of stratified-ocean conditions in the immediate aftermath of the latest Permian transgression. The sharp drop in $\delta$13Ccarb at the PTEB in the platform ramp environments likely resulted from the depth-selective calcification of 13C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) formed by respiration of organic matter including, perhaps, methane. Indeed, massive volcanism at the PTEB would have enhanced eutrophication and stratification thereby slowing the mixing of 13C-depleted DIC into deeper-water environments.},

abstract = {Examination of Lower Triassic carbonate rocks from around the world has revealed the resurgence of atypical carbonates that were last common during the Proterozoic ('anachronistic facies'). Anachronistic facies are attributed to a combination of post-extinction paleoecologic factors and widespread, harsh environmental conditions, particularly the presence of anoxic, alkaline waters in the global ocean. The marine rocks of the Moenkopi Formation (Virgin Limestone) of southern Nevada and laterally equivalent deep-water limestones of the Union Wash Formation of east-central California provide a means to reconstruct depositional environments across a Lower Triassic carbonate ramp and place the atypical facies and fabrics that occur within those rocks into a larger 'Anachronistic Platform Model.' Examination of shallow subtidal and intertidal facies reveal widespread ooid shoals in both the Union Wash Formation and Virgin Limestone, as well as the presence of small, fringing stromatolite bioherms in shallow subtidal environments of the Union Wash Formation. Inner to middle ramp environments of the Virgin Limestone contain aggregates of cabbage-head stromatolites that formed 1-2 m-high patch-reef bioherms, in addition to flat-pebble conglomerates, mud-chip facies and wrinkle structures. Deep-water facies from the Union Wash Formation contain synsedimentary calcium carbonate precipitates that form laterally extensive crusts in basinal environments, or interlocking mosaics of hemispheres and fans in outer ramp to slope environments. The results of this study reveal that carbonate sedimentation during the Early Triassic was controlled by a combination of biotic factors, environmental stresses, unusual oceanic chemistry and normal carbonate sedimentary processes that resulted in the development of carbonate platforms that had affinities to both Phanerozoic and Proterozoic depositional systems.},

A-1{\%}shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka before the main extinction was probably generated by possible dissociation of methane hydrate by warming. Subsequent mixing of anoxic stratified ocean led to another-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 5 ka during the extinction. The-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka after the main extinction has probably resulted from massive denudation of soil and sediments caused by the collapse of forests and possible dissociation of methane hydrate at the end of the Permian. Furthermore, a dramatic drop of $\Delta$13C values from 29-30{\%} in Bed 24e-3 to 25{\%} in Bed 25 indicates an abrupt proliferation of phototrophic sulfur bacteria immediately after the main episode of the end-Permian mass extinction. The $\Delta$13C value increases to 29-30{\%} in Bed 26 again, and this is probably due to massive denudation of soil and sediment caused by the collapse of forests between 0 and 27 ka after the main extinction, as revealed by negative shift of $\delta$13C. Low $\Delta$13C value recorded in Beds 27-29 indicates that phototrophic sulfur bacteria may have thrived again and lasted more than 150 ka after the main extinction in the low-latitude Paleo-Tethys. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years. Yet, relatively little is known of its evolution during the first two billion years, due to the scarceness and generally poor preservation of fossilized biological material. Cyanobacteria, formerly known as blue green algae were among the first crown Eubacteria to evolve and for more than 2.5 billion years they have strongly influenced Earth's biosphere. Being the only organism where oxygenic photosynthesis has originated, they have oxygenated Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere, triggered the evolution of plants --being ancestral to chloroplasts-- and enabled the evolution of complex life based on aerobic respiration. Having such a strong impact on early life, one might expect that the evolutionary success of this group may also have triggered further biosphere changes during early Earth history. However, very little is known about the early evolution of this phylum and ongoing debates about cyanobacterial fossils, biomarkers and molecular clock analyses highlight the difficulties in this field of research. Although phylogenomic analyses have provided promising glimpses into the early evolution of cyanobacteria, estimated divergence ages are often very uncertain, because of vague and insufficient tree-calibrations. Results of molecular clock analyses are intrinsically tied to these prior calibration points, hence improving calibrations will enable more precise divergence time estimations. Here we provide a review of previously described Precambrian microfossils, biomarkers and geochemical markers that inform upon the early evolution of cyanobacteria. Future research in micropalaeontology will require novel analyses and imaging techniques to improve taxonomic affiliation of many Precambrian microfossils. Consequently, a better understanding of early cyanobacterial evolution will not only allow for a more specific calibration of cyanobacterial and eubacterial phylogenies, but also provide new dates for the tree of life.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {1 We compiled and standardized sediment trap data below 1000 m depth from 52 locations around the globe to infer the implications of the Armstrong et al. 2002 "ballast'' model to the ratio of organic carbon to calcium carbonate in the deep sea (the rain ratio). We distinguished three forms of mineral ballast: calcium carbonate, opal, and lithogenic material. We concur with Armstrong et al. 2002 that organic carbon sinking fluxes correlate tightly with mineral fluxes. Based on the correlations seen in the trap data, we conclude that most of the organic carbon rain in the deep sea is carried by calcium carbonate, because it is denser than opal and more abundant than terrigenous material. This analysis explains the constancy of the organic carbon to calcium carbonate rain ratio in the deep sea today, and argues against large changes in the mean value of this ratio in the past. However, sediment trap data show variability in the ratio in areas of high relative calcium carbonate export (mass CaCO3/mass ratio {\textgreater} 0.4), unexplainable by the model, leaving open the possibility of regional variations in the rain ratio in the past.},

abstract = {The transition from the Triassic to Jurassic Period, initiating the 'Age of the dinosaurs', approximately 200 Ma, is marked by a profound mass extinction with more than 50{\%} genus loss in both marine and continental realms. This event closely coincides with a period of extensive volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) associated with the initial break-up of Pangaea but a causal relationship is still debated. The Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary is recently proposed in the marine record at the first occurrence datum of Jurassic ammonites, post-dating the extinction interval that concurs with two distinct perturbations in the carbon isotope record. The continental record shows a major palynological turnover together with a prominent change in tetrapod taxa, but a direct link to the marine events is still equivocal. Here we develop an accurate chronostratigraphic framework for the T-J boundary interval and establish detailed trans-Atlantic and marine-continental correlations by integrating astrochronology, paleomagnetism, basalt geochemistry and geobiology. We show that the oldest CAMP basalts are diachronous by 20 kyr across the Atlantic Ocean, and that these two volcanic pulses coincide with the end-Triassic extinction interval in the marine realm. Our results support the hypotheses of Phanerozoic mass extinctions resulting from emplacement of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) and provide crucial time constraints for numerical modelling of Triassic-Jurassic climate change and global carbon-cycle perturbations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Lower Triassic sedimentary and carbonate/organic carbon isotope records from the Tulong area (South Tibet) are documented in their integrality for the first time. New age control is provided by ammonoid and conodont biostratigraphy. The basal Triassic series consists of Griesbachian dolomitic limestones, similar to the Kathwai Member in the Salt Range (Pakistan) and to the Otoceras Beds in Spiti (India). The overlying thin-bedded limestones of Dienerian age strongly resemble the Lower Ceratite Limestone of the Salt Range. They are followed by a thick series of dark green, silty shales of Dienerian-early Smithian age without fauna that strikingly resemble the Ceratite Marls of the Salt Range. This interval is overlain by thin-bedded, light grey fossil-rich limestones of middle to late Smithian age, resembling the Upper Ceratite Limestone of the Salt Range. These are followed by a shale interval of early Spathian age that has no direct counterpart in other Tethyan sections. Carbonate production resumes during the late early and middle Spathian with the deposition of red, bioclastic nodular limestone ("Ammonitico Rosso" type facies). Apart from its colour this facies is similar to the one of the Niti Limestone in Spiti and of the Spathian nodular limestone in Guangxi (South China). As in other Tethyan localities such as Spiti, the early-middle Anisian part of the Tulong section is strongly condensed and is characterized by grey, thin-bedded limestones with phosphatized ammonoids. As for many other Tethyan localities the carbon isotope record from Tulong is characterized by a late Griesbachian-Dienerian positive $\delta$ 13C carb excursion (2‰), and a very prominent positive excursion (5‰) at the Smithian-Spathian boundary, thus confirming the well-documented perturbations of the global carbon cycle following the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {While the end-Permian extinction in the marine realm is well known from the Tethys Ocean, it remains little studied in the vast Panthalassic Ocean. Opal Creek, Alberta, Canada is a biostratigraphically continuous Permian– Triassic Boundary (PTB) section that is interpreted to have been deposited in a deep outer shelf setting along the Panthalassicwestern margin of Pangaea. Signi!cant organic carbon and nitrogen isotope excursions precede the extinction of the dominant Late Permian benthic organisms (siliceous sponges). Geochemical comparison with underlying Guadalupian age rocks and analysis of the conodont fauna suggest that the latest Permian at Opal Creek records the shutdown of a productive cold-water upwelling ecosystem with a mid-water column oxygen minimum followed by the transition to a warm and less vigorously circulating system with a bottom-water oxygen minimum. The transition from a low-diversity, cold-water conodont fauna in the Middle Permian to a more diverse latest Permian fauna containing equatorial species coincides with a transition from elevated !15N values characteristic of coastal zones with denitri!cation in a mid-water oxygen minimum to more normal marine values. A spike in the !13C of organic carbon following a latest Permian marine transgression alongwestern Pangaea is here attributed to transient increased productivity in the photic zone preceding the main extinction, likely related to the synergistic effects of warming, increased nutrient runoff, and residual upwelling. This is followed by an equilibration to lower !13Corg values characteristic of a lower productivity regime in the Early Triassic.},

abstract = {Autochthonous biomarker distributions were studied in an array of different subfacies of a Devonian carbonate complex (represented in platform, reef and off-platform shelf-basinal systems). It revealed that biomarkers are sensitive indicators of depositional environments and may serve to refine palaeoenvironmental interpretations of carbonate complexes based on "classical" sedimentological/facies analyses. The contrasting biomarker composition of the carbonate platform and reef complex versus shelf-basin deposits is here interpreted as the effect of both more diverse biotic sources of a primary organic matter in the former environments (highly scattered results of sterane distribution) and contrasting styles of decay and bacterial reworking of the primary biomass. Peritidal dolostones deposited under anoxic to suboxic conditions, and with scarce sedimentological evidence of elevated salinity, reveal the highest potential of organic matter preservation among other platform/reefal facies. Their biomarker composition includes several compounds indicating hypersaline conditions and anoxia whereas others, in particular gammacerane, indicate that the water-column was stratified during sedimentation. This observation constrains environmental interpretation of these deposits, pointing to shallow-subtidal lagoons with elevated salinity and low-oxygen near-bottom waters most probably originating from a salinity-controlled stratification of the water-column. Biomarkers diagnostic of green sulphur bacteria were found in both peritidal/lagoonal dolostones and shelf-basinal facies. This indicates the existence of photic zone anoxia in the latter environment, thus suggesting a shallow position of the redoxcline. The Frasnian/Famennian mass extinction event(s) apparently had no impact on the biomarker distribution in the shelf-basinal system continuous across the stage boundary. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Theoretical considerations (i.e., partition coefficients, water/rock ratio, chemistry of interstitial meteoric water) of elemental behaviour during diagenetic stabilization with meteoric waters suggests that it leads to a decrease in strontium, sodium, and possibly magnesium and an increase in manganese, iron, and zinc in progressively altered carbonates. Such elemental behaviour is exhibited by the different carbonate components of the Mississippian Burlington Limestone of Iowa and Missouri and the Silurian Read Bay Formation of Arctic Canada. In the Burlington Limestone the rock matrix (e.g., biosparite), the enclosed crinoids, and to some degree the rugose corals are chemically similar. The crinoid ossicles have average strontium content of 160 ppm, rugose corals 180 ppm, and the enclosing biosparite 120 ppm. In contrast, in the Read Bay Formation each of the above mentioned components has a specific chemistry, with 210 ppm strontium for crinoids, 780 ppm for rugose corals, and 360 ppm for their enclosing micrite matrix. These chemical trends are accompanied by textural changes of the host carbonate sediments. In the Burlington Limestone this involves the presence of depositional sparite, whereas in the Read Bay Formation this increase in textural maturity involves the transition from micrite to microspar to minor pseudospar and sparite. The combination of these textural trends with the elemental patterns shows that the degree with which a particular carbonate component approaches either the open system or the partly closed system equilibrium is dictated by its respective mineralogical stability and the water/rock ratio. While the results show that the carbonate assemblage may act as a completely open diagenetic system (e.g., Burlington Limestone), available data for the majority of studied sequences (e.g., Read Bay Formation) suggest that diagenetic equilibration ceases while some original depositional differences in chemical composition are still preserved. This implies that diagenetic stabilization proceeds through partly closed reaction zones on solid-liquid interfaces. Transfer of the chemical and textural information from the dissolving phase (original sedimentary carbonate particle) to the precipitating phase (diagenetic carbonate component) proceeds via a Messenger Film water in the reaction zone, which is in disequilibrium with the meteoric bulk aquifer water. Thus the chemical composition of carbonate components of ancient limestones may serve as a potential tool for evaluating the degree of diagenesis and for deducing the original mineralogy of the different stabilized carbonate phases. Application of this trace element model suggests that Paleozoic crinoids were composed originally of metastable high-magnesium calcite, rugose corals were composed originally of stable low-magnesium calcite or high-magnesium calcite with low Mg (super 2+) content, and micrite was origially aragonite lime mud.},

abstract = {The end of the Permian period is marked by global warming and the biggest known mass extinction on Earth. The crisis is commonly attributed to the formation of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province although the causal mechanisms remain disputed. We show that heating of Tunguska Basin sediments by the ascending magma played a key role in triggering the crisis. Our conclusions are based on extensive field work in Siberia in 2004 and 2006. Heating of organic-rich shale and petroleum bearing evaporites around sill intrusions led to greenhouse gas and halocarbon generation in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and atmospheric ozone depletion. Basin scale gas production potential estimates show that metamorphism of organic matter and petroleum could have generated {\textgreater} 100,000 Gt CO2. The gases were released to the end-Permian atmosphere partly through spectacular pipe structures with kilometre-sized craters. Dating of a sill intrusion by the U-Pb method shows that the gas release occurred at 252.0 +/- 0.4 million years ago, overlapping in time with the end-Permian global warming and mass extinction. Heating experiments to 275 degrees C on petroleum-bearing rock salt from Siberia suggests that methyl chloride and methyl bromide were significant components of the erupted gases. The results indicate that global warming and ozone depletion were the two main drivers for the end-Permian environmental crisis. We demonstrate that the composition of the heated sedimentary rocks below the flood basalts is the most important factor in controlling whether a Large Igneous Provinces causes an environmental crisis or not. We propose that a similar mechanism could have been responsible for the Triassic-Jurassic (similar to 200 Ma) global warming and mass extinction, based on the presence of thick sill intrusions in the evaporite deposits of the Amazon Basin in Brazil.

abstract = {Permian-Triassic boundary microbialites (PTBMs) are thin (0.05-15 m) carbonates formed after the end-Permian mass extinction. They comprise Renalcis-group calcimicrobes, microbially mediated micrite, presumed inorganic micrite, calcite cement (some may be microbially influenced) and shelly faunas. PTBMs are abundant in low-latitude shallow-marine carbonate shelves in central Tethyan continents but are rare in higher latitudes, likely inhibited by clastic supply on Pangaea margins. PTBMs occupied broadly similar environments to Late Permian reefs in Tethys, but extended into deeper waters. Late Permian reefs are also rich in microbes (and cements), so post-extinction seawater carbonate saturation was likely similar to the Late Permian. However, PTBMs lack widespread abundant inorganic carbonate cement fans, so a previous interpretation that anoxic bicarbonate-rich water upwelled to rapidly increase carbonate saturation of shallow seawater, post-extinction, is problematic. Preliminary pyrite framboid evidence shows anoxia in PTBM facies, but interbedded shelly faunas indicate oxygenated water, perhaps there was short-term pulsing of normally saturated anoxic water from the oxygen-minimum zone to surface waters. In Tethys, PTBMs show geographic variations: (i) in south China, PTBMs are mostly thrombolites in open shelf settings, largely recrystallised, with remnant structure of Renalcis-group calcimicrobes; (ii) in south Turkey, in shallow waters, stromatolites and thrombolites, lacking calcimicrobes, are interbedded, likely depth-controlled; and (iii) in the Middle East, especially Iran, stromatolites and thrombolites (calcimicrobes uncommon) occur in different sites on open shelves, where controls are unclear. Thus, PTBMs were under more complex control than previously portrayed, with local facies control playing a significant role in their structure and composition.},

abstract = {A high-resoln. chemostratigraphic study of a 24-m-thick section at West Blind Fiord on Ellesmere Island (Canadian Arctic) documents stepwise environmental deterioration in the marine Sverdrup Basin during the late Changhsingian (late Late Permian) as a result of volcanic disturbances to surrounding landmasses. A horizon within the upper Lindstrom Formation (datum A) is characterized by increased Fe-oxyhydroxide fluxes and weathering intensity as well as modest shifts toward more reducing water-mass conditions and higher marine productivity, recording an initial disturbance that washed soils into the marine environment. The contact between chert of the Lindstrom Formation and silty shale of the overlying Blind Fiord Formation, which is 1.6 m higher and ∼50 k.y. younger than datum A, records a large increase in detrital sediment flux, more strongly enhanced marine productivity, and a regional extinction of siliceous sponges, herein termed the "Arctic extinction event.". The horizon equiv. to the latest Permian mass extinction of Tethyan shallow-marine sections is 5.6 m higher and ∼100 k.y. younger than the Arctic extinction event, demonstrating the diachronous nature of the marine biotic and environmental crisis at a global scale; it is assocd. with intensified anoxia and possible changes in phytoplankton community compn. in the study section. Marine environmental deterioration in the Sverdrup Basin, probably triggered by terrestrial ecosystem deterioration and elevated detrital sediment fluxes, was under way by the early part of the late Changhsingian, well before the onset of main-stage Siberian Traps flood basalt volcanism. The event sequence at West Blind Fiord may record the deleterious effects of early-stage explosive silicic eruptions that affected the Boreal region, possibly through deposition of toxic gas and ash within a restricted latitudinal band, while having little impact on marine ecosystems in the peri-equatorial Tethyan region.

abstract = {Abstract Organic materials across the palynologically defined Permian‐ Triassic (P‐ T) boundary from five major terrestrial basins in the interior of the former Gondwana Supercontinent show large to very large (5‰-15‰) multiple negative spikes of $\delta$13C, separated in places by sharp reversals of up to 20‰. Large oscillations of $\delta$13Corg between −36‰ and −15‰ from mean values of {\~{}} {\$}24\backslashpm 2{\$} in India, {\~{}} {\$}26\backslashpm 2{\$} in Madagascar, and {\~{}} {\$}23\backslashpm 2{\$} in South Africa occur before and after the P‐ T transition. The mean values are within the range of modern C3 plants ({\~{}}−25‰). The negative $\delta$13Corg spikes of the terrestrial plant remains complement similar spikes of smaller amplitude recorded globally in marine carbonates across the P‐ T boundary. Sensitivity analyses of carbon fluxes in a coupled atmosphere‐ ocean system indicate that the sharp declines in terrestrial and marine $\delta$13C can be explained by episodic release of methane from clathrates ({\~{}}−60‰) either directly into the atmosphere or via the oceans, possibly during the disintegration of the southern continental shelf of Tethys. The rapid increases in $\delta$13C may either signal aborted attempts of C4 plants ({\~{}}−13‰) to establish themselves at the expense of C3 plants or, more likely, reflect a punctuated increase in C3 biomass production related to elevated atmospheric CO2. Detection of a gradual negative trend in the Upper Permian and a similar positive recovery in the Lower Triassic, separated by up to three large negative $\delta$13C spikes across the P‐ T boundary in at least four terrestrial sections, caution against models of the end‐ Paleozoic biodiversity collapse and ensuing Mesozoic recovery based on a singular perturbation at the P‐ T boundary. Rather, these transitions may reflect multiple ecosystem stability states and abrupt responses during gradual forcing of a complex nonlinear system with thresholds.},

The n1 phosphate band at 960 cm−1 shifts slightly due to carbonate substitution in both A and B sites. The spectrum of type A carbonated apatite exhibits two n1 PO4 3− bands at 947 and 957 cm−1. No significant change was observed in the n2 and n4 phosphate mode regions in any carbonated samples. The n3 PO4 3− region seems to be more affected by carbonation: two main bands were observed, as in the hydroxyapatite spectrum, but at lower wave numbers. The phosphate spectra of all biominerals apatite were consistent with type AB carbonated apatite. In the enamel spectrum, bands were observed at 3513 and at 3573 cm−1 presumably due to two different hydroxyl environments. Two different bands due to the carbonate n1 mode were identified depending on the carbonate substitution site A or B, at 1107 and 1070 cm−1, respectively. Our results, compared with the infrared data already reported, suggest that even low levels of carbonate substitution induce modifications of the hydroxyapatite spectrum. Increasing substitution ratios, however, do not bring about any further alteration. The spectra of dentine and bone showed a strong similarity at a micrometric level. This study demonstrates the existence of acidic phosphate, observable by Raman microspectrometry, in mature biominerals. The HPO4 2− and CO3 2− contents increase from enamel to dentine and bone, however, these two phenomena do not seem to be correlated.},

abstract = {This Discussion Meeting Issue of the Philosophical Transactions A had its genesis in a Discussion Meeting of the Royal Society which took place on 10-11 October 2011. The Discussion Meeting, entitled 'Warm climates of the past: a lesson for the future?', brought together 16 eminent international speakers from the field of palaeoclimate, and was attended by over 280 scientists and members of the public. Many of the speakers have contributed to the papers compiled in this Discussion Meeting Issue. The papers summarize the talks at the meeting, and present further or related work. This Discussion Meeting Issue asks to what extent information gleaned from the study of past climates can aid our understanding of future climate change. Climate change is currently an issue at the forefront of environmental science, and also has important sociological and political implications. Most future predictions are carried out by complex numerical models; however, these models cannot be rigorously tested for scenarios outside of the modern, without making use of past climate data. Furthermore, past climate data can inform our understanding of how the Earth system operates, and can provide important contextual information related to environmental change. All past time periods can be useful in this context; here, we focus on past climates that were warmer than the modern climate, as these are likely to be the most similar to the future. This introductory paper is not meant as a comprehensive overview of all work in this field. Instead, it gives an introduction to the important issues therein, using the papers in this Discussion Meeting Issue, and other works from all the Discussion Meeting speakers, as exemplars of the various ways in which past climates can inform projections of future climate. Furthermore, we present new work that uses a palaeo constraint to quantitatively inform projections of future equilibrium ice sheet change.},

About 15 {\%} of the pyrite in sediments of the euxinic basin of Green Lake forms in the water column. The bulk of pyrite in both euxinic and oxic sediments forms in the upper similar to 10 cm of the sediment and is limited by availability of reactive iron. Oxic and euxinic sediments in Green Lake cannot be clearly distinguished on the basis of concentrations of organic carbon or pyrite, degree of pyritization, or sulfur isotopic ratios of pyrite, but can be distinguished by using size distributions of pyrite framboids, Therefore, Fe-S-C relations in ancient shales must be used with caution when attempting to reconstruct paleoenvironmental redox conditions.},

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this extinction and yet still remain greatly debated. Here, we report analyses of all four sulphur isotopes ((32)S, (33)S, (34)S and (36)S) for pyrites in sedimentary rocks from the Meishan section in South China. We observe a sulphur isotope signal (negative $\delta$(34)S with negative $\Delta$(33)S) that may have resulted from limitation of sulphate supply, which may be linked to a near shutdown of bioturbation during shoaling of anoxic water. These results indicate that episodic shoaling of anoxic water may have contributed to the profound biodiversity crisis before the final catastrophe. Our data suggest a prolonged deterioration of oceanic environments during the Late Permian mass extinction.},

abstract = {The aftermath of the great end-Permian period mass extinction 252 Myr ago shows how life can recover from the loss of {\textgreater}90{\%} species globally. The crisis was triggered by a number of physical environmental shocks (global warming, acid rain, ocean acidification and ocean anoxia), and some of these were repeated over the next 56 Myr. Ammonoids and some other groups diversified rapidly, within 13 Myr, but extinctions continued through the Early Triassic period. Triassic ecosystems were rebuilt stepwise from low to high trophic levels through the Early to Middle Triassic, and a stable, complex ecosystem did not re-emerge until the beginning of the Middle Triassic, 89 Myr after the crisis. A positive aspect of the recovery was the emergence of entirely new groups, such as marine reptiles and decapod crustaceans, as well as new tetrapods on land, including eventually dinosaurs. The stepwise recovery of life in the Triassic could have been delayed either by biotic drivers (complex multispecies interactions) or physical perturbations, or a combination of both. This is an example of the wider debate about the relative roles of intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of large-scale evolution.},

abstract = {About 75{\%} of extant sponge species use dissolved silicon (DSi) to build a siliceous skeleton. We show that silicon (Si) uptake by sublittoral Axinella demosponges follows an enzymatic kinetics. Interestingly, maximum uptake efficiency occurs at experimental DSi concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sponge habitats, being unachievable in coastal waters of modern oceans. Such uptake performance appears to be rooted in a former condition suitable to operate at the seemingly high DSi values characterizing the pre-Tertiary ({\textgreater}65 mya) habitats where this sponge lineage diversified. Persistence of ancestral uptake systems causes sponges to be outcompeted by the more efficient uptake of diatoms at the low ambient DSi levels characterizing Recent oceans. Yet, we show that sublittoral sponges consume substantial coastal DSi (0.01-0.90 mmol Si m(-2) day(-1)) at the expenses of the primary-production circuit. Neglect of that consumption hampers accurate understanding of Si cycling on continental margins.},

abstract = {The first appearance of Hindeodus parvus (Kozur {\&} Pjatakova) at the Permian-Triassic (P-T) GSSP level (base of Bed 27c) at Meishan is here confirmed. Hin- deodus changxingensisWang occurs from Beds 26 to 29 at Meishan and appears to be restricted to the narrow boundary interval immediately above the main mass extinction level in Bed 25. It is suggested that this species is therefore a valuable P-T boundary interval index taxon. Our collections from the Shangsi section confirm that the first occurrence of Hindeodus parvus in that section is about 5 m above the highest level from which a typical Permian fauna is recovered. This may suggest that that some section may be missing at Meis- han. The age of the currently defined Permian-Triassic Boundary is estimated by our own studies and a re- assessment of previous worker's data at c. 253 Ma, slightly older than our IDTIMS 206Pb/238U age of 252.5 ±0.3 Ma for Bed 28, just 8 cm above the GSSP boundary (Mundil et al., 2001). The age of the main mass extinc- tion, at the base of Bed 25 at Meishan, is estimated at slightly older than 254 Ma based on an age of {\textgreater}254 Ma for the Bed 25 ash. Regardless of the absolute age of the boundary, it is evident that the claimed {\textless}165,000 y short duration for the negative carbon isotope excur- sion at the P-T boundary (Bowring et al., 1998) cannot be confirmed. Purportedly extraterrestrial fullerenes at the boundary (Becker et al., 2001) have equivocal sig- nificance due to their chronostratigraphic non-unique- ness and their occurrence in a volcanic ash.},

abstract = {In post-Cambrian time, five events—the end-Ordovician, end-Frasnian in the Late Devonian, end-Permian, end-Triassic, and end-Cretaceous—are commonly grouped as the ‘‘big five'' global intervals of mass extinction. Plotted by magnitude, extinction intensities for all Phanerozoic substages show a continuous distribution, with the five traditionally recognized mass extinctions located in the upper tail. Plotted by time, however, proportional extinctions clearly divide the Phanerozoic Eon into six stratigraphically coherent intervals of alternating high and low extinction in- tensity. These stratigraphic neighborhoods provide a temporal context for evaluating the intensity of extinction during the ‘‘big five'' events. Compared with other stages and substages in the same neighborhood, only the end-Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous extinction intensities appear as outliers. Moreover, when origination and extinction are considered together, only these three of the ‘‘big five'' events appear to have been generated exclusively by elevated extinction. Low origination contributed more than high extinction to the marked loss of diversity in the late Frasnian and at the end of the Triassic. Therefore, whereas the ‘‘big five'' events are clearly times when diversity suffered mass depletion, only those at the end of theOrdovician, Permian, and Cretaceous periods unequivocally qualify as globally distinct mass extinctions. Each of the three has a unique pattern of extinction, and the diversity dynamics of these events differ, as well, from the other two major diversity depletions. As mass depletions of diversity have no common effect, common causation seems unlikely.},

abstract = {The inner shelf off west coast of India, is covered with late Holocene to recent organic rich, silty-clay dominant sediments. High TOC content and sedimentation rates result in high sulfate reduction rates in this region (Mazumdar et al., 2009). In the present study, we have investigated the nature of pyrite and C-Fe-S geochemistry in a sediment core (covering the last 378years) at a water depth of 17m off Goa, west coast, India, to understand the diagenetic and palaeoclimatic/oceanographic processes. The chromium reducible sulfur (CRS) and highly reactive iron (Fe HR) profiles show significant fluctuations and a negative correlation with ?? 34S CRS, which is attributed to relative availability of highly reactive and less reactive iron bearing minerals close to the sediment water interface. Low ?? 34S CRS corresponding to high CRS content characterizes early diagenetic pyritization near the sediment-water interface, whereas high ?? 34S CRS and low CRS content indicate late diagenetic pyritization of less reactive iron during burial. High OBS/CRS ratios suggest the important role played by the labile organic compound in binding sulfur in the sediment. Partitioning of stable sulfur isotopes into organic and iron bound phases is apparently linked to Fe HR and labile organic matter availability. We have proposed Fe HR profile and Fe HR/Fe T ratios as a potential tool to understand runoff/monsoonal fluctuations in a shallow marine depositional setting. To develop this tool into a potential paleoclimatic/oceanographic proxy and to link it to other proxies within a chronological framework, needs high resolution sampling and age dating. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Siberian Traps flood basalts have been invoked as a trigger for the catastrophic end-Permian mass extinction. Widespread aberrant plant remains across the Permian-Triassic boundary provide evidence that atmospheric stress contributed to the collapse in terrestrial diversity. We used detailed estimates of magmatic degassing from the Siberian Traps to complete the first three-dimensional global climate modeling of atmospheric chemistry during eruption of a large igneous province. Our results show that both strongly acidic rain and global ozone collapse are possible transient consequences of episodic pyroclastic volcanism and heating of volatile-rich Siberian country rocks. We suggest that in conjunction with abrupt warming from greenhouse gas emissions, these repeated, rapidly applied atmospheric stresses directly linked Siberian magmatism to end-Permian ecological failure on land. Our comprehensive modeling supplies the first picture of the global distribution and severity of acid rain and ozone depletion, providing testable predictions for the geography of end-Permian environmental proxies.},

abstract = {Barite particles 0.5-5 $\mu$m in size are ubiquitous in the ocean and their formation, sinking and dissolution is a major part of the marine barium cycle. Barite formation appears to be caused by biological activity in the upper water column, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Analysis of 1-53 $\mu$im and {\textgreater}53 $\mu$m sized particles obtained by large volume in situ filtration in the Atlantic suggests that barites are formed in the {\textgreater}53$\mu$m fraction in near-surface waters and released into the 1-53 $\mu$m fraction at depths below the euphotic zone. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis of both size fractions shows first, that barites are formed almost exclusively in microenvironments containing decaying organic matter and the remains of siliceous plankton, and second that barites do not appear to be actively formed by the planktonic organism sampled. This explains the origin of suspended barite, and the similarity of dissolved Si and Ba distributions in the ocean. Suspended and sedimented barite may indicate the intensity of organic matter regeneration in the water column.},

abstract = {The carbonate carbon isotope record of Lower Triassic shelf sediments was investigated in the Pufels and L´Om Picol (Uomo) sections of the western central Dolomites to derive a complete record from the Permian/Triassic transition to the uppermost Lower Triassic from the western Tethys. The carbon isotope record shows the well-studied decrease at the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB), followed by an increase to about 1.5‰. At the Dienerian/Smithian boundary the $\delta$13C values increase to a pronounced + 6‰ maximum. A steady rapid drop until the upper Smithian below − 2‰ follows this $\delta$13C peak. At the Smithian/Spathian transition, a steep rise to positive values is documented. The positive carbon isotope peak is interpreted to reflect an interval of enhanced burial of organic carbon, whereas the isotopic minima provide evidence of periods of oxidation of organic matter and/or release of isotopically light carbon. This may be ascribed to quickly changing environmental conditions, which have already been postulated by paleontologists due to the delayed biotic recovery from the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Because of the short-time interval these positive isotope excursions represent, their generation by burial of organic carbon in periods of high productivity and/or anoxia appears plausible. Concurrent carbon isotopic excursions are reported from Iran, Pakistan and Oman as well as from Southern China, which indicate an at least Tethys-wide event. If the excursion proves to be of global significance, dark shale deposited in the pelagic Panthalassa Ocean may have acted as sink for organic carbon, supporting the hypothesis of a periodically stratified ocean in the Lower Triassic.},

@article{Yin2007,
abstract = {The Permo-Triassic crisis was a major turning point in geological history. Following the end-Guadalupian extinction phase, the Palaeozoic biota underwent a steady decline through the Lopingian (Late Permian), resulting in their decimation at the level that is adopted as the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). This trend coincided with the greatest Phanerozoic regression. The extinction at the end of the Guadalupian and that marking the end of the Permian are therefore related. The subsequent recovery of the biota occupied the whole of the Early Triassic. Several phases of perturbations in ??13Ccarb occurred through a similar period, from the late Wuchiapingian to the end of the Early Triassic. Therefore, the Permian-Triassic crisis was protracted, and spanned Late Permian and Early Triassic time. The extinction associated with the PTB occurred in two episodes, the main act with a prelude and the epilogue. The prelude commenced prior to beds 25 and 26 at Meishan and coincided with the end-Permian regression. The main act itself happened in beds 25 and 26 at Meishan. The epilogue occurred in the late Griesbachian and coincided with the second volcanogenic layer (bed 28) at Meishan. The temporal distribution of these episodes constrains the interpretation of mechanisms responsible for the greatest Phanerozoic mass extinction, particularly the significance of a postulated bolide impact that to our view may have occurred about 50,000??Myr after the prelude. The prolonged and multi-phase nature of the Permo-Triassic crisis favours the mechanisms of the Earth's intrinsic evolution rather than extraterrestrial catastrophe. The most significant regression in the Phanerozoic, the palaeomagnetic disturbance of the Permo-Triassic Mixed Superchron, widespread extensive volcanism, and other events, may all be related, through deep-seated processes that occurred during the integration of Pangea. These combined processes could be responsible for the profound changes in marine, terrestrial and atmospheric environments that resulted in the end-Permian mass extinction. Bolide impact is possible but is neither an adequate nor a necessary explanation for these changes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In order to address this problem, hard tissue histology is reviewed paying particular attention to the relationships during growth of the component hard tissues comprising conodont elements, and ignoring a priori assumptions of the homologies of these tissues. Conodont element growth is considered further in terms of the pattern of formation, of which four distinct types are described, all possibly derived from a primitive condition after heterochronic changes in the timing of various developmental stages. It is hoped that this may provide further means of unravelling conodont phylogeny. The manner in which the tissues grew is considered homologous with other vertebrate hard tissues, and the elements appear to have grown in a way similar to the growing scales and growing dentition of other vertebrates.},

@article{Collin2009,
abstract = {The Permian-Triassic boundary interval in shallow shelf seas of South China shows Upper Permian limestones overlain by lowermost Triassic microbialites. Global sea-level rose across the Permian-Triassic boundary, but an irregular top-Permian erosion surface across a 10km north-south transect of the Great Bank of Guizhou contains evidence of sea-level fluctuation. The surface represents the 'event horizon' of mass extinction, below the biostratigraphic Permian-Triassic boundary defined by first appearance datum of conodont Hindeodus parvus. An Upper Permian foraminiferal grainstone beneath this surface contains geopetal sediments, etched grains, and pendent and meniscus cements interpreted here as vadose. However, these latter diagenetic processes occurred before the event horizon and were followed by erosion of the final Permian surface. This erosion cuts previous fabrics but lacks evidence of weathering or bioerosion. A few centimetres below is an earlier grainstone that was also eroded but lacks proof of sub-aerial processes. Samples therefore reveal one, or possibly two, small-scale relative sea-level changes before the Triassic transgression in this area, and these may relate to local tectonics. The final Permian surface is subject to at least four interpretations: (i) sub-aerial physical erosion and dissolution by carbon dioxide-enriched fresh water or carbon dioxide-enriched mixed water, prior to Triassic transgression; (ii) sub-aerial physical erosion overprinted by dissolution related to carbon dioxide-enriched sea water in the Early Triassic transgression; (iii) submarine dissolution affected by acidified sea water due to rapid increase in volcanically-derived carbon dioxide and oxidized methane released from marine clathrates; (iv) submarine dissolution due to acid anoxic waters rising across the continental shelf, unrelated to atmospheric carbon dioxide or oxidized methane. Field and petrographic evidence suggests that (i) is the simplest option; and it is possible that (ii) and (iii) occurred, but none are proved. Option (iv) is unlikely given the evidence and modelling of supersaturation of upwelled waters with respect to bicarbonate. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.

Mid-paleolatitude sections from the margins of the Boreal (Spitsbergen, Greenland) and Neotethyan oceans (Western Australia) reveal intense anoxia throughout the Permian-Triassic boundary interval with euxinic conditions frequently developing, and dysoxia encountered even in relatively shallow-water settings above storm wave base. At equatorial paleolatitudes, weakly oxygenated (dysoxic) conditions are widely developed in a broad range of water depths including those shallow enough to produce oolite deposition, although euxinia was rare. Western and eastern Tethyan locations reveal a complex and unstable redox history: anoxia in the Hindeodus praeparvus Zone was replaced by oxygenated facies in the Permian-Triassic boundary interval (H. changxingensis to H. parvus zones). Oxygen-poor deposition returned during the succeeding Isarcicella isarcica Zone. The more persistent and intense development of oxygen restriction in cooler water, mid-paleolatitude sections argues against warming and dissolved oxygen decline as the key cause of Permian-Triassic boundary anoxia. In higher paleolatitudes the benthic invertebrate extinctions occurred during a prolonged phase of oxygen-poor deposition, while in equatorial Tethyan locations benthic losses occurred at the end of the first anoxic phase (in the late H. praeparvus Zone).},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic boundary at Nhi Tao, Cao Bang Province, Vietnam was sampled in a 7.5-m-thick outcrop section at high resolution (∼ 5 cm intervals) for chemostratigraphic and magnetic susceptibility analysis. The section consists entirely of slightly argillaceous limestone representing shallow-marine facies of the Jinxi Platform, one of several large carbonate platforms within the Nanpanjiang Basin, located on the southern margin of the South China Craton. Upper Permian strata (Beds 1-7) are mainly dark-gray, cherty fossiliferous wackestones and packstones containing a diverse open-marine fauna, whereas uppermost Permian and Lower Triassic strata (Beds 9 and higher) are medium-gray calcimicrobial framestones containing rare macrofossils. These facies are separated by a 12-cm-thick oolitic-pisolitic grainstone (Bed 8) that coincides with the disappearance of most Late Permian faunal elements as well as with the first appearance of various geochemical anomalies that continue into the Lower Triassic part of the section. This "Late Permian event horizon" is characterized by (1) an abrupt decline in total organic carbon to near-zero values, (2) the onset of a sustained decline in carbonate $\delta$13C, and (3) the first of eight concentration peaks in pyrite sulfur. Significantly, each sulfide peak is associated with lower pyrite $\delta$34S values as well as with the onset of a negative carbonate $\delta$13C excursion (or the acceleration of an excursion already in progress). These chemostratigraphic relationships are consistent with multiple episodes of upwelling of sulfidic, 34S- and 13C-depleted deep-ocean waters onto the Jinxi Platform. The first upwelling event was the most intense and caused a drastic reduction in primary productivity and the demise of the Late Permian fauna; subsequent episodes were less intense but may have contributed to a delay in recovery of Early Triassic marine ecosystems. A ten-fold increase in magnetic susceptibility in Bed 9 may record the influx of fine detrital particles following destruction of terrestrial ecosystems and massive soil erosion. The terrestrial signal of the end-Permian catastrophe thus follows the marine signal with a 12-cm lag, which may reflect the time-of-transit of soil-derived particles across the Nanpanjiang Basin, suggesting that the marine and terrestrial crises in the Nhi Tao region occurred more-or-less synchronously. These observations suggest a model in which renewal of global-ocean overturn followed a prolonged interval of deep-ocean stagnation during the Late Permian, with upwelling intensity modulated by short-term (∼ 20 kyr) climate cyclicity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The metabolic activities of microbial mats have likely regulated biogeochemical cycling over most of Earth's history. However, the relationship between metabolic activity and the establishment of isotopic geochemical gradients in these mats remains poorly constrained. Here we present a parallel microgeochemical and microbiological study of micron-scale sulfur cycling within hypersaline microbial mats from Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Dissolved sulfide within the mats was captured on silver discs and analyzed for its abundance and delta(34)S isotopic composition using high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). These results were compared to sulfide and oxygen microelectrode profiles. Two-dimensional microgeochemical mapping revealed well-defined laminations in sulfide concentration (on scales from 1 to 200 microm), trending toward increased sulfide concentrations at depth. Sulfide delta(34)S decreased from approximately +10 per thousand to -20 per thousand in the uppermost 3 mm and oscillated repeatedly between -10 per thousand and -30 per thousand down to a depth of 8 mm. These variations are attributed to spatially variable bacterial sulfate reduction within the mat. A parallel examination of the spatial distribution of known sulfate-reducing bacteria within the family Desulfobacteraceae was conducted using catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. Significant concentrations of Desulfobacteraceae were observed in both oxic and anoxic zones of the mat and occurred in several distinct layers, in large aggregates and heterogeneously dispersed as single cells throughout. The spatial distribution of these microorganisms is consistent with the variation in sulfide concentration and isotopic composition we observed. The parallel application of the methodologies developed here can shed light on micron-scale sulfur cycling within microbially dominated sedimentary environments.},

abstract = {We have combined several different methodologies to quantify rates of organic carbon mineralization by the various electron acceptors in sediments from the coast of Denmark and Norway. Rates of NH4+ and Sigma CO2 liberation sediment incubations were used with O2 penetration depths to conclude that O2 respiration accounted for only between 3.6-17.4{\%} of the total organic carbon oxidation. Dentrification was limited to a narrow zone just below the depth of O2 penetration, and was not a major carbon oxidation pathway. The processes of Fe reduction, Mn reduction and sulfate reduction dominated organic carbon mineralization, but their relative significance varied depending on the sediment. Where high concentrations of Mn-oxide were found (3-4 wt{\%} Mn), only Mn reduction occurred. With lower Mn oxide concentrations more typical of coastal sediments, Fe reduction and sulfate reduction were most important and of a similar magnitude. Overall, most of the measured O2 flux into the sediment was used to oxidized reduced inorganic species and not organic carbon. We suspect that the importance of O2 respiration in many coastal sediments has been overestimated, whereas metal oxide reduction (both Fe and Mn reduction) has probably been well underestimated.},

abstract = {Sedimentary S cycling is usually conceptualized and interpreted within the context of steadily accreting (1-D) transport-reaction regimes. Unsteady processes, however, are common in many sedimentary systems and can result in dramatically different S reaction balances and diagenetic products than steady conditions. Globally important common examples include tropical deltaic topset and inner shelf muds such as those extending from the Amazon River ???1600km along the Guianas coast of South America. These deposits are characterized by episodic reworking of the surface seabed over vertical depths of ???0.1-3m. Reworked surface sediments act as unsteady, suboxic batch reactors, unconformably overlying relict anoxic, often methanic deposits, and have diagenetic properties largely decoupled from net accumulation of sediment. Despite well-oxygenated water and an abundant reactive organic matter supply, physical disturbance inhibits macrofauna, and benthic communities are dominated by microbial biomass across immense areas. In the surficial suboxic layer, molecular biological analyses, tracer experiments, sediment C/S/Fe compositions, and ??34S, ??18O of pore water SO42- indicate close coupling of anaerobic C, S, and Fe cycles ??18O-SO42- can increase by 2-3??? during anaerobic recycling without net change in ??34S-SO42-, demonstrating SO42- reduction coupled to complete anaerobic reoxidation to SO42- and a ??18O-SO42- reduction+reoxidation fractionation factor???12??? (summed magnitudes). S reoxidation must be coupled to Fe-oxide reduction, contributing to high dissolved Fe2+ (???1mM) and Fe mobilization-export. The reworking of Amazon-Guianas shelf muds alone may isotopically alter ??18O-SO42- equivalent in mass to???25{\%} of the annual riverine delivery of SO42- to the global ocean. Unsteady conditions result in preservation of unusually heavy ??34S isotopic compositions of residual Cr reducible S, ranging from 0??? to {\textgreater}30??? in physically reworked deposits. In contrast, bioturbated facies adjacent to physically reworked regions accumulate isotopically light S (??34S to -20???) in otherwise similar decomposition regimes. The isotopic patterns of both physically and biologically reworked regions can be simulated with simple diagenetic models. Heavy S isotopic signatures are largely a consequence of unsteady diffusion and progressive anaerobic burndown into underlying deposits, whereas isotopically depleted bioturbated deposits predominantly reflect biogenic diffusive scaling and isotopic distillation/diffusive pumping associated with reoxidation in burrow walls immediately adjacent to reduced zones. The S isotopic transition from unsteady physically controlled regions of the Amazon delta moving laterally into bioturbated facies mimics the transition of S isotopic patterns temporally in the geologic record during the rise of bioturbation. No special role for S disproportionation is required to explain these differences. The potential role of unsteady, suboxic diagenesis and dynamic reworking of sediments has been largely ignored in models of the evolution of surficial elemental cycling and interpretations of the geologic record. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A comparison between seawater sulfate and marine carbonate carbon isotope records reveals no clear systematic coupling between the sulfur and carbon cycles over one to several millions of years, indicating that changes in the burial rate of pyrite sulfur and organic carbon did not singularly control the atmospheric oxygen content over short time intervals in the Cenozoic.

abstract = {Latest Permian to the Middle Triassic mixed siliciclastic-carbonate shelf deposits of the northern Gondwana margin have been studied in four sections (Nammal, Chhidru, Chitta-Landu, and Narmia) in the Salt Range and Surghar Range of Pakistan. Sedimentological and palynofacies patterns combined with a high resolution ammonoid based age control have been used to assess environmental changes such as sea-level change, distance from the shore, and oxygenation conditions of the sections in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. The base and the top of the Early Triassic are marked by second order sequence boundaries (SRT1, SRT8). Within the Early Triassic two third order sequence boundaries could be delineated by means of palynofacies analysis and sedimentology, one near the Dienerian-Smithian (SRT2) and the second one near the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SRT5). The extinction event at the Smithian-Spathian boundary seems to be closely associated to the latter globally recorded sea-level low stand. Five additional sequences of undetermined order (SRT3, SRT 4, SRT5/1, SRT6, and SRT7) are reflected in the sedimentological record of the studied sections. The observed changes in the composition of the particulate organic matter (POM) indicate a general shallowing upward trend, which is modulated by smaller transgressive-regressive cycles supporting the sedimentologically defined sequences. The POM is mostly dominated by terrestrial phytoclasts and sporomorphs. The strongest marine signal is reflected by increased abundance of amorphous organic matter (AOM) in the lower part of the Ceratite Marls at Nammal (late Dienerian) and Chhidru (earliest Smithian) and the Lower Ceratite Limestone at Chitta-Landu (late Dienerian). AOM of marine origin is characteristic for deeper, distal basinal settings and is preferentially preserved under dysoxic and anoxic conditions, indicating reduced oxygen conditions during these intervals. Up-section transgressive events are reflected by increased numbers of acritarchs, reaching up to 50{\%} of the POM. Well oxygenated conditions and low total organic carbon contents (TOC) continue up to the top of the Early Triassic (Mianwali Formation). The most pronounced terrestrial influx is expressed in the Middle Triassic. Organic carbon isotope data parallel the carbonate carbon isotope records from the Tethyan realm; therefore, they reflect real global changes in the carbon cycle independent of the OM composition. The biomarker study of the apolar hydrocarbons of three samples from the Nammal section indicates an enhanced bacterial productivity, especially in the Smithian and Spathian, reflected in high relative abundances of hopanes. POM, TOC data and redox sensitive biomarkers together with high resolution biostratigraphy demonstrate that well-oxygenated environmental conditions prevailed in the Early Triassic with the exception of the Dienerian to earliest Smithian interval. The POM assemblages of Late Permian to late Griesbachian age indicate well oxygenated conditions during this time interval. There is no evidence in support of an anoxic event in the late Griesbachian in these sections.},

abstract = {We studied the stratigraphy, composition, and paleomagnetic properties of lateritic weathering profiles of Permian age from northern Iran and western Karakoram, Pakistan. A limited set of samples deemed representative yielded stable low-inclination paleomagnetic components carried essentially by hematite of chemical origin isolated in massive, fine-grained, and homogeneous ferricrete facies. These laterites originated at equatorial paleolatitudes characterized by intense weathering processes under warm and humid climatic conditions. Paleomagnetic estimates of paleolatitude from Iran, Karakoram, and north Tibet from this study and the literature, albeit sparse, provide testable constraints on the motion of the Cimmerian terranes as the result of the opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean along the eastern margin of Gondwana during the Permian. We confirm and help refine previous suggestions that the Cimmerian terranes migrated from southern Gondwanan paleolatitudes in the Early Permian to subequatorial paleolatitudes by the Middle Permian - Early Triassic. As a novel conclusion, we find that timing, rates, and geometry of Cimmerian tectonics are broadly compatible with the transformation of Pangea from an Irvingian B to a Wegenerian A-type configuration with Neo-Tethyan opening taking place contemporaneously essentially in the Permian.},

Poorly fossiliferous claystones across the boundary have relatively low $\delta$15N values and low concentrations of redox-sensitive elements, characteristic of an oxic environment with significant terrestrial input. The Early Jurassic features enrichment in $\delta$15N coincident with high redox-sensitive element concentrations, indicating an increase in water column denitrification and decreased oxygen concentrations. These redox state variations are concordant with shifts in abundance and species composition in terrestrial and marine microflora. We propose that the mass extinction at the T-J boundary was caused by a series of events resulting in a long period of stratification, deep-water hypoxia, and denitrification in this region of the Tethys Ocean basin.},

abstract = {As climates change across already stressed ecosystems, there is no doubt that species will be affected, but to what extent and which will be most vulnerable remain uncertain. The fossil record suggests that most species persisted through past climate change, whereas forecasts of future impacts predict large-scale range reduction and extinction. Many species have altered range limits and phenotypes through 20th-century climate change, but responses are highly variable. The proximate causes of species decline relative to resilience remain largely obscure; however, recent examples of climate-associated species decline can help guide current management in parallel with ongoing research.},

abstract = {Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) sections from isolated carbonate platforms in the Nanpanjiang Basin of south China contain Upper Permian skeletal packstones with diverse open-marine fossils overlain by a 7-15 m thick boundary horizon composed of calcimicrobial framestone constructed by globular to tufted, calcified cyanobacteria similar to Renalcis. The framestone contains interbeds of lime-grainstone with abundant thin-shelled bivalves and brachiopods. The overlying Lower Triassic strata contain microgastropod lime-packstones followed by a thick succession of thin-bedded lime-mudstones. The PTB event horizon is interpreted to occur at the top of the packstone containing diverse, open-marine fauna and Palaeofusulina and coincident with the abrupt change to calcimicrobial framestone lacking Permian macrofossils. The conformable biostratigraphic boundary occurs at the first appearance of Hindeodus parvus within the basal meter of the calcimicrobial framestone. Intensively studied PTB sections in south China, such as the GSSP at Meishan, primarily are condensed sections from deep-water, basin environments that contain a thin ({\textless} 30 cm) boundary horizon of claystone and lime-mudstone or marl. The sections reported herein are fundamentally different in that they consist of shallow-marine carbonate facies, contain a thick boundary horizon composed of calcimicrobial framestone, and lack evidence of an abrupt shift in depositional environment or water depth. The calcimicrobial framestone boundary horizon occurs in all of the isolated carbonate platforms in the Nanpanjiang Basin. A similar microbial facies has been found in the basal Triassic H. parvus zone in the Sichuan Basin and in Japan. Distribution of the calcimicrobial framestone suggests that it may represent an anomalous oceanic event that affected a vast area of the equatorial eastern Tethys and Panthalassa during and/or immediately following the end-Permian mass extinction. The persistence of similar calcimicrobial framestone horizons into the Upper Scythian suggests that detrimental environmental conditions associated with the extinction persisted until the end of the Scythian. Further study of these sections promises to provide constraints on causes of the extinction and the environments in the aftermath.},

abstract = {A negative shift in marine inorganic carbon-isotope composition ([delta]13Ccarb) during the end-Permian mass extinction has been used as evidence for several different extinction mechanisms. Changes to the [delta]13C of organic matter and the difference between it and [delta]13Ccarb ([Delta]13C = [delta]13Ccarb - [delta]13Corg) have been examined at few locations, with conflicting interpretations. We examine the changes to both organic and inorganic carbon isotopes across the Permian-Triassic boundary at two marine sections from South China (Meishan and Shangsi) and compare these to data from other previously published sections. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that a decrease in [Delta]13C occurred during the extinction event throughout the Paleo-Tethys ocean. The extent and intensity of the decrease varies by location averaging a negative shift of {\~{}} 5[per mille sign]. Several possibilities as to the cause of this shift exist including Siberian trap volcanism, a change in the terrestrial/marine organic carbon input to the system, or a change in the dominant marine biota brought about through environmental changes (such as widespread ocean anoxia/euxinia). The decrease in [Delta]13C observed at many of these sections across the event horizon is here interpreted to represent a shift from algae/cyanobacteria to less fractionating phototrophic sulfur bacteria in marine shelf environments resulting from upward excursions of the chemocline. These chemocline upward excursions would release euxinic water to the photic zone allowing phototrophic sulfur bacteria to thrive. The limited available biomarker data are consistent with this interpretation.},

abstract = {Focusing on the Permian-Triassic boundary, ca. 251 Ma, I explore the possibility that mass extinction can be caused by an extremely fast, explosive release of dissolved methane (and other dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) that accumulated in the oceanic water masses prone to stagnation and anoxia (e.g., in silled basins). The mechanism of the explosive release is the same as in the Lake Nyos disaster of 1986, i.e., a water-column eruption caused by the interplay of buoyancy forces and exsolution of dissolved gas. The eruption brings to the surface deep anoxic waters that cause extinctions in the marine realm. Terrestrial extinctions are caused by explosions and conflagrations that follow the massive release of methane (the air-methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5{\%} and 15{\%}) and by the eruption-triggered floods. This scenario accounts well for the available data, and may be relevant to other phenomena.},

@article{Svensen2011,
abstract = {The end-Permian biotic crisis is commonly associated with rapid and severe climatic changes. These climatic changes are commonly suggested to have originated from solid Earth carbon degassing (leading to global warming), but aerosol- and ash-induced cooling induced by lava degassing has been suggested as well. The application of an Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity has enabled a visualisation of the major climatic shifts on the supercontinent Pangaea caused by rapid temperature changes due to changed radiative properties from greenhouse gases. The reconstructed reference climate was validated by latest Permian climate indicative sediments to investigate the possible climatic shifts. From a set of 22 reconstructions which varied with temperature a minimum global annual mean temperature of 18.2 °C for the late Permian climate prior to the climatic perturbation event was determined. Starting from this pre-event setup, global warming and global cooling scenarios were simulated. The response of the end Permian climate system to temperature increase and decrease show marked differences. While global cooling is followed by major climatic changes in the high latitudes and replacement of boreal biomes by tundra and polar frost, the changes during global warming are less pronounced with only locally increasing aridity compensated by humidisation in other regions. The different behaviour of the climatic belts under warm and cold conditions is accompanied by different climate sensitivities caused by different strength of the snow cover–albedo feedback. Thus, changes in the energy balance of the latest Permian surface–troposphere system have a 30{\%} higher perturbation potential during cold climate conditions than during warmhouse conditions. Therefore substantial global cooling resulting in coldhouse climate conditions and an annual global mean temperature below 18 °C is more efficient in perturbing the Earth palaeoclimate during the end-Permian warmhouse. The results suggest that global cooling mechanisms as injection of sulphur aerosols and ash particles from the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province into the Late Permian palaeoatmosphere have a higher climate perturbation potential than a warming due to carbon greenhouse gases with a similar magnitude of radiative forcing.},

@article{Osen2012a,
abstract = {Evidence from stratigraphic sections of the Panthalassa, Paleo-Tethys and Neo-Tethys suggests that the oceans experienced widespread anoxia during the Late Permian, which likely contributed to the extinction of 90{\%} of marine and 70{\%} of terrestrial species. The Late Permian and Early Triassic were also characterized by significant carbon isotope excursions implying that considerable perturbations in the carbon cycle occurred. Bathymetric features of the Panthalassa during this period are not well known since most of the ocean floor has been subducted; however, tectonic reconstructions suggest that active marine subduction zones surrounded Pangea. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there was an active mid-ocean ridge system located in Panthalassa during the Late Permian. In this study, the impact of such a spreading center within Panthalassa on the climate and carbon cycle is investigated using a comprehensive climate system model for the end-Permian. This is a novel approach because a majority of previous simulations assumed a flat bottom for the Panthalassa deep-sea. The mid-ocean ridge (MOR) simulation enhanced vertical mixing and topographic steering of the currents near the ridge-axis but in comparison with the simulation using a flat bottom, changes in the global distribution of water masses and circulation in the Panthalassa were insignificant. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were not considerably affected by the implementation of the mid-ocean ridge. Thus the approximation of using a flat-bottom topography in ocean models for the Late Permian remains valid. In a second sensitivity study, the effect of a sill between the deep Paleo-Tethys and Panthalassa on water mass distribution and oxygen content has been investigated. Model results suggest that the introduction of a sill led to enhanced stratification, as well as an increase in salinity and temperature in the Paleo-Tethys. An associated reduction of the dissolved oxygen concentration to dysoxic to near-anoxic conditions below 1800 m suggests that the changes in sill height between the Paleo-Tethys and Panthalassa may have been a contributing factor of regional importance to the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.},

abstract = {Conodonts, microfossils composed of carbonate-fluor apatite, are abundant in Palaeozoic–Triassic sediments and have a high potential to preserve primary oxygen isotope signals. In order to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Devonian, the oxygen isotope composition of apatite phosphate was measured on 639 conodont samples from sequences in Europe, North America and Australia. The Early Devonian (Lochkovian; 416–411 Myr) was characterized by warm tropical temperatures of around 30 °C. A cooling trend started in the Pragian (410 Myr) with intermediate temperatures around 23 to 25 °C reconstructed for the Middle Devonian (397–385 Myr). During the Frasnian (383–375 Myr), temperatures increased again with temperatures to 30 °C calculated for the Frasnian–Famennian transition (375 Myr). During the Famennian (375–359 Myr), surface water temperatures slightly decreased. Reconstructed Devonian palaeotemperatures do not support earlier views suggesting the Middle Devonian was a supergreenhouse interval, an interpretation based partly on the development of extensive tropical coral–stromatoporoid communities during the Middle Devonian. Instead, the Devonian palaeotemperature record suggests that Middle Devonian coral–stromatoporoid reefs flourished during cooler time intervals whereas microbial reefs dominated during the warm to very warm Early and Late Devonian.},

abstract = {A combined field/laboratory study has been undertaken to explore the mineralogy, concentrations and reactivity (towards sulfide) of iron in marine sediments. Also considered is the importance of bacterial Fe liberation in regulating pore-water chemistry. Two contrasting marine environments are included; one is the relatively Fe-poor FOAM site and the other is the Fe-rich sediment of the subaqueous Mississippi Delta. Results show that oxide minerals are the most important Fe phases in early diagenetic pyrite formation. However, viewed separately, lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite are more reactive towards sulfide than goethite and hematite. When Fe oxides are present in relatively high concentrations, dissolved sulfide is nearly absent from sediment pore waters (with concomitant high concentrations of dissolved Fe), even in the presence of active sulfide production by sulfate reduction. A combination of experimental results and diagenetic modelling shows that in some sediments pore water Fe finds it origin in the bacterial reduction of iron oxides. This seems the case even though greater amounts of Fe are reduced by reaction of sulfide with iron oxides. It appears that distinct microenvironments may exist in marine sediments, where, in one microenvironment, sulfide reacts with Fe oxides locally precipitating Fe sulfide minerals. In another, Fe reduced and solubilized by microorganisms migrates freely into solution. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Assemblages of acritarchs, prasinophytes, and miospores were recovered from the uppermost Iquiri and lower portion of the Itacua formations in southeast Bolivia. Analysis of the diverse and somewhat abundant well-preserved palynomorph assemblage indicates a Late Devonian (late Famennian) age for both formations, and further subdivision in ascending stratigraphic order into the ?VCo, LL, LE, and LN miospore biozones of Western Europe. The presence of age-diagnostic miospore taxa from South America and North America indicates contemporaneous glaciation events between these two regions. The results from close sampling of the diamictite facies of the Itacua Formation at the Bermejo West section, Bolivia, correlate the latest Famennian spore inceptions used to define the Euramerica miospore biozone sequence (LL, LE, and LN zones). The Itacua Formation diamictite sequence examined is relatively thin compared to other diamictite sequences in Bolivia. Furthermore, the miospore biozones represent an estimated duration of three million years, whereas orbitally-forced glacial-interglacial events (e.g., Ruddiman, 2001) are of the Milankovitch frequency range of between 20,000 and 400,000. years. Therefore, it seems most likely that a number of glacial/interglacial events are represented, rather than a single glacial episode. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Molar-tooth structures are intricately crumpled, microsparry calcite fissure fills that formed during the Precambrian. Strontium isotope stratigraphy constrains the last occurrence of volumetrically significant molar-tooth structure (MT) in the geological record to ∼ 750 Ma. Although the disappearance of MT is commonly ascribed to the influence of metazoans on sediment cohesion, this now seems less plausible because there is no evidence for significant sediment disruption by metazoans before ∼ 550 Ma. It is proposed here that the most likely alternative explanation for MT disappearance is a change in ocean chemistry. A decrease in CaCO3 saturation and/or an increase in the concentration of precipitation inhibitors in mid-Neoproterozoic seawater may have contributed to MT disappearance, and might also help to explain the approximately contemporaneous decline in stromatolite diversity.},

abstract = {The global carbon cycle experienced a major perturbation during the Permian-Triassic transition, reflected inter alia in a large increase in the vertical (shallow-to-deep) gradient of carbonate ??13C (??13Ccarb) in Early Triassic seas. However, the effect of this perturbation on the vertical gradient of organic matter ??13C in seawater (??13Corg) is less known to date. Here, we examine geographic and secular variations in ??13Corg in Late Permian-Early Triassic seas of the South China craton and their implications for contemporaneous changes in microbial community composition and paleoredox conditions. Vertical ??13Corg gradients document the existence of a narrow and relatively shallow oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ) within the open-ocean Northern Deepwater Basin (NDW) and a deeper and thicker OMZ within the semi-restricted Nanpanjiang Basin (NPJB). For the pre-extinction interval, ??13Corg gradients between the shallow and intermediate watermasses of the NDB and between the shallow and deep watermasses of the NPJB record contributions to the sediment of organic matter from bacteria living below the ocean-surface layer. These bacteria were mainly anaerobic chemoautotrophs that inhabited suboxic to anoxic waters of an OMZ and that produced more strongly 13C-depleted organic matter than surface-water eukaryotic algae, thus increasing ??13Corg. For the post-extinction interval, a reversed ??13Corg in the NDB is attributed to blooms of green sulfur bacteria or other anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria that were resident in a deep chlorophyll maximum layer and that had smaller carbon isotopic fractionation than surface-water algae. Although quantitatively important in intermediate- to deep-water areas during the Early Triassic, such bacteria were absent in coeval shallow-water sections, reflecting water-depth controls on microbial community composition. A concurrent flatting of the ??13Corg gradient in the NPJB was caused by a return of oxic conditions and/or a decline of primary productivity in the surface ocean. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We have examined the relative affinity of Th, Pa and Be for sorption from seawater onto particles of variable composition (opal, carbonate, lithogenic particles and organic carbon). Nuclide concentrations in particles collected from time-series sediment traps were normalized by the dissolved nuclide concentration in the overlying water column in order to compute partition coefficients under conditions spanning a wide range of particle flux and particle composition. Our results suggest that the affinity of particles for Pa and Be increases with their increasing opal content and decreasing carbonate content, while the affinity of particles for Th increases with increasing carbonate content, and decreases with increasing opal content. We find no correlation between the aluminosilicate content of particles and their affinity for scavenging of any of these elements. Extrapolating to a pure CaCO3 end member, the partition coefficient for Th (9.0 x 10(6) g g(-1)) is similar to40 times greater than for Pa, and roughly 100 times greater than for Be, whereas for a pure opal end member, the partition coefficient for Th (3.9 x 10(5) g g(-1)) is slightly less than that for Pa and Be. Partition coefficients decrease with increasing particle flux in open-ocean settings, but not in an ocean-margin region. This kinetic effect reflects the increasing contribution of unaltered surface material reaching the sediment traps as particle flux increases. The degree of fractionation between Pa and Th and between Be and Th depends on the opal:carbonate rain ratio. These results challenge the use of sedimentary Pa-231/Th-230 and Be-10/Th-230 ratios as simple proxies of particle flux. However, the strong dependence of nuclide scavenging on the opal:carbonate rain ratio may provide a needed tool for reconstructing past changes in planktonic community composition.

The sediments record a negative excursion in $\delta$13Ccarb values of 8‰–9‰, and in $\delta$13Corg values of 10‰–11‰. The presence of the conodont Hindeodus parvus, combined with the $\delta$13Ccarb record, enables correlation with the proposed global stratotype section at Meishan. This shows that the Greenland section is the most expanded P-Tr section known. Collapse of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems took between 10 and 60 k.y. It took a further few hundred thousand years for the final disappearance of Permian floral elements. Collapse of the terrestrial and marine ecosystems began at the same stratigraphic level and preceded the sharp negative excursion in the $\delta$13C record.},

abstract = {Chemical reactions in marine sediments and the resulting fluxes across the sediment-water interface influence the global carbon cycle and the pH of the sea and affect the abundance of CaCO3 and opal-forming plankton in the ocean. On very long timescales these diagenetic reactions control carbon burial in sedimentary rocks and the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Sedimentary deposits that remain after diagenesis are the geochemical artifacts used for interpreting past changes in ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycles, and climate. This chapter is about the processes of diagenesis and burial of the chemical elements that make up the bulk of the particulate matter that reaches the seafloor (organic matter, CaCO3, SiO2, Fe, Mn, and aluminosilicates).Understanding of sediment diagenesis and benthic fluxes has evolved with advances in both experimental methods and modeling. Measurements of chemical concentrations in sediments, their associated pore waters and fluxes at the sediment-water interface have been used to identify the most important reactions. Because transport in pore waters is usually by molecular diffusion, this medium is conducive to interpretation by models of heterogeneous chemical equilibrium and kinetics. Large chemical changes and manageable transport mechanisms have led to elegant models of sediment diagenesis and great advances in understanding of diagenetic processes.We shall see, though, that the environment does not yield totally to simple models of chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics, and laboratory determined constants often cannot explain the field observations. For example, organic matter degradation rate constants determined from modeling are so variable that there are essentially no constraints on these values from laboratory experiments. In addition, reaction rates of CaCO3 and opal dissolution determined from modeling pore waters usually cannot be reproduced in laboratory experiments of these reactions. The inability to mechanistically understand reaction kinetics calculated from diagenesis models is an important uncertainty in the field today.Processes believed to be most important in controlling the preservation of organic matter have evolved from a focus on the lability of the substrate to the protective mechanisms of mineral-organic matter interactions. The specific electron acceptor is not particularly important during very early diagenesis, but the importance of oxygen to the degradation of organic matter during later stages of diagenesis has been clarified by the study of diagenesis in turbidites deposited on the ocean floor during glacial periods.Evolution of thinking about the importance of reactions between seawater and detrital clay minerals has come full circle since the mid-1960s. "Reverse weathering" reactions were hypothesized in very early chemical equilibrium (Sillen, 1961) and mass-balance ( Mackenzie and Garrels, 1966) models of the oceans. Subsequent observations that marine clay minerals generally resemble those weathered from adjacent land and the discovery of hydrothermal circulation put these ideas on the back burner. Recent studies of silicate and aluminum diagenesis, however, have rekindled awareness of this process, and it is back in the minds of geochemists as a potentially important process for closing the marine mass balance of some elements.},

abstract = {The shergottite and ALH84001 meteorites hold keys for understanding geologic and possibly biologic processes on Mars. Recently, it has been proposed that carbonates in ALH84001, and the Fe-sulfides they contain, are products of extraterrestrial biogenic activity (McKay et al., 1996). Here we report ion microprobe analyses of sulfides in shergottites and ALH84001. The sulfur isotope ratios of igneous pyrrhotites in shergottites (mean delta(34)S(CDT):Shergotty = -0.4 parts per thousand, Zagami = +2.7 parts per thousand, EETA79001A = -1.9 parts per thousand, EETA79001B = -1.7 parts per thousand, LEW88516 = -1.9 parts per thousand, QUE94201 = +0.8 parts per thousand) are similar to those of terrestrial ocean-floor basalts, suggesting that the sulfur isotopic composition of the Martian mantle may be similar to that of the mantle of the Earth. The sulfur isotopic systematics of ALH84001 sulfides are distinct from the shergottites. Measured sulfur isotope ratios of eight pyrite grains (delta(34)S(CDT) = +2.0 to +7.3 parts per thousand) in crushed zones confirm previously reported analyses of isotopically heavy sulfides (Shearer et al., 1996) and are indistinguishable from an Fe-sulfide zone within a carbonate globule (delta(34)S(CDT) = +6.0 parts per thousand). Analyses of synthesized, fine-grained mixtures of sulfide, carbonate, and magnetite indicate that the measured sulfur isotope ratio is independent of the presence of carbonate and magnetite in the sputtered volume, confirming the accuracy of the analysis of the fine-grained sulfide in the carbonate globule. Terrestrial biogenic sulfate reduction typically results in light isotopic enrichments. The similarity of delta(34)S values of the sulfides in ALH84001 imply that the Fe-sulfide zones within ALH84001 carbonates are probably not the result of bacterial reduction of sulfate.

abstract = {Conodonts from U.S. Midcontinent cyclothems were studied for oxygen isotopes in order to constrain Pennsylvanian glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations. Pennsylvanian deposits of the Midcontinent United States are composed of cyclic alternations of thin transgressive limestones, offshore gray to black phosphatic shales, and thick regressive limestones, a sequence that is underlain and overlain by nearshore to terrestrial shales with paleosols and coal beds. Glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations are considered the primary cause for the formation of these cyclothems. Oxygen isotope analyses of conodont apatite from the black (20.1 ± 0.5‰, Vienna standard mean ocean water [VSMOW]) and gray shale units (20.5 ± 0.5‰, VSMOW) show lowest average $\delta$18O values, whereas conodont elements from the regressive (21.0 ± 0.3‰, VSMOW) and transgressive limestone units (21.1 ± 0.6‰, VSMOW) are enriched in 18O. The maximum change in $\delta$18O of conodonts from the black shale and carbonate units from individual cyclothems is 1.7‰. The 1.7‰ difference in $\delta$18O compares relatively well to Pleistocene interglacial-glacial changes in $\delta$18O of equatorial surface-dwelling foraminifers and suggests that Pennsylvanian glacioeustatic sea-level changes may have been of comparable amplitude. However, since the Pennsylvanian glacial maxima are represented by terrestrial sediments and are not documented in the conodont oxygen isotope record, Pennsylvanian glacioeustatic sea-level changes were probably larger than the 120 m fluctuations recorded for the Pleistocene glaciations.},

abstract = {During the Cretaceous period ({\~{}}145–65 million years ago), there were several periods of global ocean anoxia, each lasting less than one million years. These events, known as ocean anoxic events, were marked by significant increases in organic carbon burial, and are generally attributed to increased primary productivity in surface waters. The details underpinning the initiation, maintenance and termination of these events, however, remain equivocal. Here we present sulphur isotope data spanning the Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (about 94.5 million years ago) from sedimentary rocks in Colorado that were formed in the Western Interior Seaway; this seaway ran north–south, splitting North America during the Cretaceous. Sulphate levels increased rapidly from relatively low background levels at the onset of the event, most likely from the release of sulphur by massive volcanism, and fell during the anoxic event. We infer that the input of sulphate facilitated increased carbon remineralization, which enhanced nutrient recycling and increased global primary productivity, eventually resulting in widespread ocean anoxia. Our scenario indicates that Ocean Anoxic Event 2 may have persisted until sulphate levels were stabilized by the formation and burial of the sulphur mineral pyrite, which returned primary productivity to background levels. We suggest that fluctuations in sulphate levels may have regulated the marine carbon cycle during past periods of low oceanic sulphate concentration.},

abstract = {Conodont, C isotope and fossil and facies data are presented for the Capitanian (Middle Permian) mass extinction record seen in platform carbonates (Maokou and Wuchiaping formations) of South China, where limestones interdigitate with the volcanic succession of the Emeishan large igneous province. The Maokou Formation provides an extinction record marked by the loss of keriothecal-walled fusulinaceans and a turnover in calcareous algae. In sections within the Emeishan province this crisis occurs at the base of the oldest record of volcanism from the Jinogondolella altudaensis conodont zone (of mid-Capitanian age). Around the periphery of the Emeishan province this extinction level lies within the upper part of the Maokou Formation at a level where platform carbonate deposition was frequently interrupted by thick volcanic ash depositional events. The assemblages of the uppermost Maokou Formation are characterised by typical “Late Permian” taxa although these levels still lie within the Middle Permian (Guadalupian Series). “Disaster” taxa, such as Earlandia and Diplosphaerina are locally prolifically abundant in the aftermath of the mass extinction. The crisis is particularly noteworthy amongst photosynthetic taxa such as calcareous algae and fusulinaceans that probably harboured photosymbionts. Therefore, a kill mechanism involving cooling from explosive volcanism and potentially acid rain from sulphate aerosols appears appropriate. A composite $\delta$13Ccarb curve, calibrated against a high-resolution conodont biostratigraphy reveals a major intra-Capitanian negative excursion (of {\textgreater} 5‰) superimposed on typically heavy (4–5‰) Middle Permian values. This curve can also be recognised in Panthalassan seamount carbonates of Japan although this requires reassignment of apparently Upper Permian limestones to the Middle Permian. In both China and Japan the Capitanian mass extinction occurs during the early stage of this major, intra-Capitanian negative excursion. Assuming typical platform carbonate accumulation rates, the records of the Maokou Formation suggest $\delta$13Ccarb values fell at ∼ 0.01‰/kyr suggesting a catastrophic origin (such as gas hydrate destabilisation) is unlikely, although a volcanic source is possible.},

abstract = {Most mass extinctions during the last 500 m.y. coincide with eruptions of large igneous provinces (LIPs). The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction was synchronous with the Deccan flood volcanism, the Permian-Triassic extinction with the eruption of the enormous Siberian traps, and the end-Guadalupian extinction with the Emeishan volcanic province. The causal link remains disputed, however, and many LIPs apparently had no significant impact on the biosphere. Here we show that a key control on the destructive consequences of LIP emplacement is the type of sedimentary rock in basins beneath the flood basalts. Contact metamorphism around intrusions in dolomite, evaporite, coal, or organic-rich shale generates large quantities of greenhouse and toxic gases (CO(2), CH(4), SO(2)), which subsequently vent to the atmosphere and cause global warming and mass extinctions. The release of sediment-derived gases had a far greater impact on the environment than the emission of magmatic gases.},

abstract = {Different pathways can be proposed to explain the origin of the red pigmentation present in many Phanerozoic limestones. We investigate three possible models: (1) telogenetic alteration; (2) detrital input and (3) role of iron-bacteria. The third hypothesis is supported by our data for a number of Phanerozoic series. By this hypothesis not only can we highlight the importance of the microenvironments at the dysoxicanoxic water sediment interfaces for the bacterial Fe-oxidation but also can conclude that the red limestones have no particular paleogeographic meaning. The seven studied red successions are rather poor in iron (350 ppm in the Ammonitico Rosso) without large fluctuations. The pigmentation is due to the dispersion of submicrometric (hydro)oxides (now hematite) formed by bacterial mediation during early diagenesis in various microaerophilitic environments. Different ferruginous morphs, e.g., filaments, coccoids, microstromatolites, suggest the presence of iron-bacteria. The limiting factor is the oxygen content which was low in these very quiet and relatively deep environments. The presence of iron-bacteria is also confirmed by iron isotope analysis on the Ammonitico Rosso. Fe isotopic compositions have been analyzed on residues as well as on leachates of red and grey facies of the same interval. d56Fe values are systematically lower in the red residues (varying from - 1.19 to - 0.34) compared to the grey ones (0.27 to - 0.09). This indicates a significant accumulation of lighter isotopes in the red parts suggesting that hematite have been formed via a biological pathway.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}There is evidence of ice melt, sea level rise to +5–9 m, and extreme storms in the prior interglacial period that was less than 1 °C warmer than today. Human-made climate forcing is stronger and more rapid than paleo forcings, but much can be learned by combining insights from paleoclimate, climate modeling, and on-going observations. We argue that ice sheets in contact with the ocean are vulnerable to non-linear disintegration in response to ocean warming, and we posit that ice sheet mass loss can be approximated by a doubling time up to sea level rise of at least several meters. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield sea level rise of several meters in 50, 100 or 200 years. Paleoclimate data reveal that subsurface ocean warming causes ice shelf melt and ice sheet discharge. Our climate model exposes amplifying feedbacks in the Southern Ocean that slow Antarctic bottom water formation and increase ocean temperature near ice shelf grounding lines, while cooling the surface ocean and increasing sea ice cover and water column stability. Ocean surface cooling, in the North Atlantic as well as the Southern Ocean, increases tropospheric horizontal temperature gradients, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, which drive more powerful storms. We focus attention on the Southern Ocean's role in affecting atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} amount, which in turn is a tight control knob on global climate. The millennial (500–2000 year) time scale of deep ocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} change, thus the time scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet and sea level changes. This millennial carbon cycle time scale should not be misinterpreted as the ice sheet time scale for response to a rapid human-made climate forcing. Recent ice sheet melt rates have a doubling time near the lower end of the 10–40 year range. We conclude that 2 °C global warming above the preindustrial level, which would spur more ice shelf melt, is highly dangerous. Earth's energy imbalance, which must be eliminated to stabilize climate, provides a crucial metric.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The Guadalupian-Lopingian (G-L) boundary (260.4Ma) is one of the major extinction events in Earth history that coincides with the Emeishan Large Igneous Province and palaeoclimatic changes. Carbon isotopes of whole rock samples were studied in order to document changes in the global carbon cycle. In contrast to earlier studies, we observe no major negative excursion in $\delta$13C in the middle Capitanian. A positive $\delta$13C excursion is observed in the latest Capitanian with a 1.5{\%} increase registered in the J. xuanhanensis Zone to C. postbitteri hongshuiensis Subzone, followed by a decrease of 1{\%} within the C. postbitteri postbitteri Subzone and a 2{\%} decrease in the C. dukouensis to C. asymmetrica Zone. Oxygen isotopes of conodonts from two G-L boundary sections were measured in order to reconstruct conodont habitat and potential changes in water temperature. Oxygen isotope ratios of gondolellid conodonts are higher in comparison to oxygen isotope ratios measured on hindeodid conodonts suggesting that gondollelids lived in cooler and thus deeper waters compared with hindeodids. The oxygen isotope record reconstructed from gondollelid conodonts suggests warming of water temperatures of about 4°C in the late Capitanian (J. postserrata to J. granti Zone), cooling of about 6 to 8°C across the G-L boundary and in the earliest Wuchiapingian, and again significant warming in the Wuchiapingian (C. dukouensis to C. liangshanensis Zone). The temperature increase can be correlated with the main phase of Emeishan volcanism suggesting that climatic warming may have resulted in an intensified hydrological cycle, fertilisation of the oceans and enhanced primary productivity, the latter documented in the positive late Capitanian carbon isotope excursion. However, changes in sea-level seem to parallel reconstructed water temperatures suggesting that changes in water depth in combination with superimposed climatic changes may be responsible for the observed temperature changes. This study documents that oxygen isotope studies on Permian conodonts should be performed on mono-generic conodont samples and that oxygen isotopes not only provide valuable palaeoclimatic information but also may help to constrain the life habitat of conodonts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The classical oxygen isotope paleothermometry on fossil shells, while very proficient when applied to the younger (Cenozoic) portion of the geologic record, is believed to yield only unreliable results for the Phanerozoic "deep time", either because the empirically well documented secular trend to more negative ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O values with increasing age was generated by post-depositional recrystallization processes or, if primary, implies ecologically unpalatable hot early oceans. Here we present a compilation of ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O measurements for 58,532 low-Mg calcite marine shells that cover almost the entire Phanerozoic eon, argue that the secular decline of about -6??? is primary, propose that it reflects the changing oxygen isotopic composition of sea water, and define a new baseline trend for ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O of paleo-sea water; the latter providing a new template for calculation of ambient habitat temperatures of fossil specimens. The resulting pattern for fossil taxa (foraminifera, brachiopods, belemnites and bivalves) mimics their modern counterparts in temperature ranges and modes. This conceptual framework enables application of actualistic concepts to ambient habitat temperatures of fossils and provides us with a long overdue tool for interpretation of "deep time" geologic history.},

The S(2)O(3)(2-) constituted 68 to 78 percent of the immediate HS(-)-oxidation products and was concurrently (i) reduced back to HS(-), (ii) oxidized to SO(4)(2-), and (iii) disproportionated to HS(-) + SO(4)(2-). The small thiosulfate pool is thus involved in a dynamic HS(-) - S(2)O(3)(2-) cycle in anoxic sediments. The disproportionation of thiosulfate may help account for the large difference in isotopic composition ((34)S/(32)S) of sulfate and sulfides in sediments and sedimentary rocks.},

Dissolved fluxes in rivers are related to rates of continental weathering, which in turn are strongly dependent on rates of uplift. The largest dissolved fluxes today arise in the Himalayan and Andean mountain ranges and the Tibetan Plateau. During the past 5 m.y., uplift rates in these areas have increased significantly; this suggests that weathering rates and river fluxes may have increased also. The oceanic records of carbonate sedimentation, level of the calcite compensation depth, and {\{}delta{\}}13C and {\{}delta{\}}87Sr in biogenic sediments are consistent with a global increase in river fluxes since the late Miocene. The cooling of global climate over the past few million years may be linked to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 driven by enhanced continental weathering in these tectonically active regions.},

abstract = {Several new Triassic-Jurassic boundary sections from the Eiberg Basin (Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria) have been studied at high resolution. We present integrated geochemical and biological proxy data from this western Tethys shelf basin. High-resolution correlation of Kuhjoch, the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Jurassic, Hochalplgraben and Tiefengraben shows that the initial and main Carbon Isotope Excursions (CIE) are contemporaneous with first and last occurrences of boundary defining macro- and microfossils. We focus on the end-Triassic initial CIE at the transition from the limestones of the K{\"{o}}ssen Formation to the marls of the Kendlbach Formation. This change coincides with a dramatically increased influx of conifer (Cheirolepidiaceae) pollen and increased total organic carbon (TOC) values, succeeded by an acme of green algae (Cymatiosphaera). We present a model in which increased terrestrial organic matter influx is related to enhanced seasonality and increased erosion of the hinterland. Reduced salinity of the surface waters led to the mass occurrence of green algae. Stratification of the water column may have caused anoxic bottom water conditions and black shale deposition during the initial CIE at the base of the Kendlbach Fm.},

The resultril show again the remarkable constancy of the sulphur isotope ratios for meteorites of all types. However, differences in the SBa/Sa* ratios of 0.4 {\%}a would appear to be significant. The Ssz/P4 ratio for meteorites is discussed as a possible base level from which fr{\~{}}tion{\&}tion in the earth's crust began. The vrslue is compared with estimates of average values found for terrestrial samples including some recent results of igneous intrusives. A large suite of {\~{}}a water samples collected from widely separated points in three oceans at various depths have also been investigated and the Pa/P4 ratios reported. The results show that the sulphate in the three oceans is exceedingly uniform in isotope ratio, with an enrichment of 20.1 x0 f 0.3 in 584 over that of the meteoritic standard. Sulphur isotope ratios of sulphur in a sea shell, sulphides in shallow ocean sediments, sulphate in rain water and in present-day formation of gypsum evaporites from the sea, have been measured and are compared to the sea water level. The geochemical sulphate cycle is discussed in the light of these results. IT},

abstract = {Different authors use different methods to assess Permian-Triassic palaeoecological changes, yet no comparative study of different methodologies has been published. We compared two methods of assessing palaeoecological parameters such as diversity, richness and skeletal abundance from limestone thin sections: point-counting and an equal area approach. Results demonstrated that there are significant differences between methodologies. Point-counting is relatively quick but has drawbacks. It is biased with respect to organism size, over-estimates larger taxa/bioclasts, and underestimates smaller taxa/bioclasts. Some point-counting palaeoecological data are not considered useful for measuring biotic recovery because they are affected by taphonomic processes: for example, the presence of diagenetic veins may reduce presumed skeletal abundance; winnowing may increase it. Trends in abundance between locations and regions through time, however, tend to broadly agree between methods, although we recorded Early Triassic samples with much higher skeletal abundances (up to 75{\%}) than in previous published studies. Data from locations in Italy, Oman, and USA were compared. The most diverse samples are Early Induan (Griesbachian) in age from Oman, whilst the Late Induan-Early Olenekian (Dienerian-Smithian) samples from western USA are less diverse. These data agree with previously published inferences of regional variability in recovery rates from field-based macrofossil analyses of tiering and trace fossils. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The high spatial resolution analysis of the mineral and organic composition of otoliths using Raman micro-spectrometry involves rigorous protocols for sample preparation previously established for microchemistry and trace elements analyses. These protocols often include otolith embedding in chemically neutral resin (i.e., resins which do not contain, in detectable concentration, elements usually sought in the otoliths). Such embedding may however induce organic contamination. In this paper, Raman micro-spectrometry reveals the presence of organic contamination onto the surface obtained from the use of epoxy resin, specifically Araldite. This contamination level varies depending on otolith structures. Core and checks, known as structural discontinuities, exhibit the most important level of contaminations. Our results suggest that otolith embedding with resin affects the organic matrix of the otolith, probably through an infiltration of the resin in the crystalline structure. The interpretation of chemical otolith signatures, especially Raman otolith signatures, and stable isotope analyses should then be revised in light of these results. In this respect, we propose a method for the correction of Raman otolith signatures for contamination effects.},

This excursion records a major climate-induced perturbation of the global carbon system. The delta C-13 excursion is accompanied by enrichments in manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe). The correlation of the delta C-13 excursion with trends in Mn and Fe contents reflects changes in Valanginian paleoceanography and climate. Fe enrichment occurs mainly in terrestrial, platform, and shelf regions. In a basinal direction the Fe content decreases, whereas the Mn/Fe ratio increases. An increase in sedimentary Mn and Fe concentrations is related to elevated continental weathering rates and to widespread dys- or anoxia that favored metal deposition in Valanginian sediments. Various oceanographic changes (e.g., expansion of oxygen-minimum zones) resulting from increased continental runoff led to a strong remobilization and focused reprecipitation of metals in the oceans of the Valanginian stage.},

abstract = {Detailed microfacies and paleoenvironmental analyses were conducted through the Early Triassic interval of the outer platform ammonoid-rich series of the Nanpanjiang Basin (Luolou Formation, Guangxi Province, South China). Extensive investigations on outcrops and on thin sections reveal that the widely reported well-diversified latest Permian fauna, dominated by abundant corals, calcareous algae, calcareous sponges, crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods, ostracods and foraminifera, is abruptly replaced by decimated Early Triassic communities essentially composed of low-diversity bivalves, microgastropods, ostracods, and rare foraminifera. Along with this drastic change in faunal assemblages, the recolonization of devastated habitats by calcimicrobial frameworks is observed in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. Calcimicrobialites of Griesbachian age are followed by mixed, ammonoid- and conodont-rich carbonate-siliciclastic series consisting of dark, suboxic, laminated mudstones intercalated with organic-rich shales of Dienerian to late Smithian age. The carbonate-siliciclastic series are interrupted by a brief carbonate episode during the early-middle Smithian. Massive carbonate production resumes only from the early Spathian onward and persists throughout the Spathian. The initial deposition of both carbonate episodes is coeval with (i) re-establishment of well-oxygenated conditions, (ii) a marked (early Smithian) to extreme (early Spathian) ammonoid/conodont diversification, (iii) a significant increase in the skeletal grain diversity and abundance and, (iv) peak carbon isotope values. A short interval of black, organic-rich shales precedes the onset of these two distinct carbonate events, which are both marked by a positive carbonate carbon isotope excursion known from other Tethyan marine localities. The comparison between the Early Triassic stratigraphic evolution of Tethyan outer platform paleoenvironments and platform/basin margin settings of the Nanpanjiang Basin suggests a causal connection between large fluctuations of the global carbon cycle, climate shifts, sea-level changes, oxygen availability in the oceans and the biological rediversification in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Perylene has been attributed to a wood degrading fungal source and, therefore, it seems possible these phenomena are related to the demise of land plants.

abstract = {We estimate tropical Atlantic upper ocean temperatures using oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca ratios in well-preserved planktonic foraminifera extracted from Albian through Santonian black shales recovered during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 207 (North Atlantic Demerara Rise). On the basis of a range of plausible assumptions regarding seawater composition at the time the data support temperatures between 33° and 42°C. In our low-resolution data set spanning {\&}{\#}8764;84{\&}{\#}8211;100 Ma a local temperature maximum occurs in the late Turonian, and a possible minimum occurs in the mid to early late Cenomanian. The relation between single species foraminiferal {\&}{\#}948;18O and Mg/Ca suggests that the ratio of magnesium to calcium in the Turonian-Coniacian ocean may have been lower than in the Albian-Cenomanian ocean, perhaps coincident with an ocean 87Sr/86Sr minimum. The carbon isotopic compositions of distinct marine algal biomarkers were measured in the same sediment samples. The {\&}{\#}948;13C values of phytane, combined with foraminiferal {\&}{\#}948;13C and inferred temperatures, were used to estimate atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations through this interval. Estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations range between 600 and 2400 ppmv. Within the uncertainty in the various proxies, there is only a weak overall correspondence between higher (lower) tropical temperatures and more (less) atmospheric CO2. The GENESIS climate model underpredicts tropical Atlantic temperatures inferred from ODP Leg 207 foraminiferal {\&}{\#}948;18O and Mg/Ca when we specify approximate CO2 concentrations estimated from the biomarker isotopes in the same samples. Possible errors in the temperature and CO2 estimates and possible deficiencies in the model are discussed. The potential for and effects of substantially higher atmospheric methane during Cretaceous anoxic events, perhaps derived from high fluxes from the oxygen minimum zone, are considered in light of recent work that shows a quadratic relation between increased methane flux and atmospheric CH4 concentrations. With 50 ppm CH4, GENESIS sea surface temperatures approximate the minimum upper ocean temperatures inferred from proxy data when CO2 concentrations specified to the model are near those inferred using the phytane {\&}{\#}948;13C proxy. However, atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 3500 ppm or more are still required in the model in order to reproduce inferred maximum temperatures.},

abstract = {A previously published hydrothermal brine-river water mixing model driven by ocean crust production suggests that the molar Mg/Ca ratio of seawater (mMg/Ca(sw)) has varied significantly (approximately 1.0-5.2) over Precambrian time, resulting in six intervals of aragonite-favouring seas (mMg/Ca(sw) {\textgreater} 2) and five intervals of calcite-favouring seas (mMg/Ca(sw) {\textless} 2) since the Late Archaean. To evaluate the viability of microbial carbonates as mineralogical proxy for Precambrian calcite-aragonite seas, calcifying microbial marine biofilms were cultured in experimental seawaters formulated over the range of Mg/Ca ratios believed to have characterized Precambrian seawater. Biofilms cultured in experimental aragonite seawater (mMg/Ca(sw) = 5.2) precipitated primarily aragonite with lesser amounts of high-Mg calcite (mMg/Ca(calcite) = 0.16), while biofilms cultured in experimental calcite seawater (mMg/Ca(sw) = 1.5) precipitated exclusively lower magnesian calcite (mMg/Ca(calcite) = 0.06). Furthermore, Mg/Ca(calcite )varied proportionally with Mg/Ca(sw). This nearly abiotic mineralogical response of the biofilm CaCO3 to altered Mg/Ca(sw) is consistent with the assertion that biofilm calcification proceeds more through the elevation of , via metabolic removal of CO2 and/or H+, than through the elevation of Ca2+, which would alter the Mg/Ca ratio of the biofilm's calcifying fluid causing its pattern of CaCO3 polymorph precipitation (aragonite vs. calcite; Mg-incorporation in calcite) to deviate from that of abiotic calcification. If previous assertions are correct that the physicochemical properties of Precambrian seawater were such that Mg/Ca(sw) was the primary variable influencing CaCO3 polymorph mineralogy, then the observed response of the biofilms' CaCO3 polymorph mineralogy to variations in Mg/Ca(sw), combined with the ubiquity of such microbial carbonates in Precambrian strata, suggests that the original polymorph mineralogy and Mg/Ca(calcite )of well-preserved microbial carbonates may be an archive of calcite-aragonite seas throughout Precambrian time. These results invite a systematic evaluation of microbial carbonate primary mineralogy to empirically constrain Precambrian seawater Mg/Ca.},

abstract = {Past treatments of the variation of $\delta$S34 in marine evaporites have either assumed a steady-state ocean or have invoked rather simplified ocean input-output models. This paper derives more completely the relationships between the parameters that influence the time variation of $\delta$S34 in ocean water and the relationship between $\delta$S34 in ocean water and net gains and losses of atmospheric oxygen due to the operation of the sulfur cycle. The lower and mid-Paleozoic are shown to have been periods of net gain of atmospheric oxygen by the operation of the sulfur cycle; the upper Paleozoic, particularly the Permian, a period of oxygen loss. It is difficult to relate these oxygen gains and losses to variations in the oxygen content of the atmosphere, because the oxygen flux due to the operation of the carbon cycle is approximately twice as large as the flux due to the operation of the sulfur cycle. Data for the organic carbon and sulfide content of sedimentary rocks of the Russian Platform suggest that a decrease in sulfide from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Era was roughly balanced by an increase in the proportion of organic carbon; however, such data are insufficient to define the abundance of atmospheric oxygen during the Phanerozoic. Biologic data and a better understanding of controls on atmospheric Po2 are more likely to produce convincing evidence regarding variations of atmospheric oxygen in the past.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction horizon is marked by an abrupt shift in style of carbonate sedimentation and a negative excursion in the carbon isotope (delta(13)C) composition of carbonate minerals. Several extinction scenarios consistent with these observations have been put forward. Secular variation in the calcium isotope (delta(44/40)Ca) composition of marine sediments provides a tool for distinguishing among these possibilities and thereby constraining the causes of mass extinction. Here we report delta(44/40)Ca across the Permian-Triassic boundary from marine limestone in south China. The delta(44/40)Ca exhibits a transient negative excursion of approximately 0.3 per thousand over a few hundred thousand years or less, which we interpret to reflect a change in the global delta(44/40)Ca composition of seawater. CO(2)-driven ocean acidification best explains the coincidence of the delta(44/40)Ca excursion with negative excursions in the delta(13)C of carbonates and organic matter and the preferential extinction of heavily calcified marine animals. Calcium isotope constraints on carbon cycle calculations suggest that the average delta(13)C of CO(2) released was heavier than -28 per thousand and more likely near -15 per thousand; these values indicate a source containing substantial amounts of mantle- or carbonate-derived carbon. Collectively, the results point toward Siberian Trap volcanism as the trigger of mass extinction.},

abstract = {The making of Pangea is the result of large-scale amalgamation of continents and micro-continents, which started at the end of the Neoproterozoic with the formation of Gondwana. As pieces were added to Gondwana on its South-American, Antarctica and Australia side, ribbon-like micro-continents were detached from its African and South-Chinese side: Cadomia in the late Neoproterozoic, Avalonia and Hunia in the Ordovician, Galatia in the Devonian and Cimmeria in the Permian. Cadomia was re-accreted to Gondwana, but the other ribbon-continents were accreted to Baltica, North-China, Laurussia or Laurasia. Finding the origin of these numerous terranes is a major geological challenge. Recently, a global plate tectonic model was developed together with a large geological/geodynamic database, at the Lausanne University, covering the last 600. Ma of the Earth's history. Special attention was given to the placing of Gondwana derived terranes in their original position, using all possible constraints. We propose here a solution for the Variscan terranes, another paper deals with the Altaids. The Galatian super-terrane was detached from Gondwana in the Devonian, during the opening of Paleotethys, and was quickly separated into four sub-terranes that started to by-pass each other. The leading terranes collided at the end of the Devonian with the Hanseatic terrane detached from Laurussia. In the Carboniferous, Gondwana started to impinge onto the amalgamated terranes, creating the Variscan chain and the Pangean super-continent. East of Spain Paleotethys remained opened until the Triassic, subducting northward under Laurasia. Roll-back of the Paleotethyan slab triggered the collapse of most of the European Variscan orogen, which was replaced by series of Permian rifts, some of them becoming oceanized back-arc basins during the Triassic. Major force changes at the Pangean plate limits at the end of the Triassic provoked its break-up, through the opening of the proto-Caribbean, central-Atlantic, Alpine-Tethys oceanic seaways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary interval coincides with enhanced extinction rates in the marine realm and pronounced changes in terrestrial ecosystems on the continents. It is further marked by distinct negative excursions in the $\delta$13Corg and $\delta$13Ccarb signature that may represent strong perturbations of the global carbon cycle. We present integrated geochemical, stable-isotope and palynological data from the Kuhjoch section, the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Jurassic (Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria). We show that the initial carbon isotope excursion (CIE), coinciding with the marine extinction interval and the formation of black shales in the western Tethys Eiberg Basin, is marked by only minor changes in kerogen type, which is mainly of terrestrial origin. Increased Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations of 9{\%} at the first half of the initial CIE coincide with Hydrogen Index (HI) values of over 600 mg HC/g TOC. The high correlation (with R2 = 0.93) between HI values and terrestrial Cheirolepidiaceaen conifer pollen suggests a terrestrial source for the hydrogen enriched organic compounds. The lack of major changes in source of the sedimentary organic matter suggests that changes in the $\delta$13Corg composition are genuine and represent true disturbances of the global C-cycle. The sudden decrease in total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations likely represents the onset of a biocalcification crisis. It coincides with a 4.5‰ negative shift in $\delta$13Corg values and possibly corresponds to the onset of CAMP related volcanic activity. The second half of the initial CIE is marked by the dramatic increase of green algae remains in the sediment. The simultaneous increase of the Corg/Ntot ratio suggests increased marine primary production at the final stage of black shale formation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Reexamination of distinctive phyllosilicates, unique to a single stratigraphic level, in paleosols located just above the isotopically defined Permian-Triassic boundary in Australia and Antarctica furnishes additional tests of this hypothesis. Illite is the dominant clay mineral in earliest Triassic paleosols from Antarctica, but the palleosols also contain conspicuous green nodules of coarsely crystalline berthierine. Examples from the geologic record and from experimental studies indicate that the formation of berthierine is restricted to reducing conditions. The occurrence of this unusual mineral in soils may indicate soil oxygen consumption by the influx of atmospheric methane to form carbon dioxide, which in turn warmed the earliest Triassic, giving rise to a postapocalyptic greenhouse.},

abstract = {As the chronicle of plate motions through time, paleogeography is fundamental to our understanding of plate tectonics and its role in shaping the geology of the present-day. To properly appreciate the history of tectonics - and its influence on the deep Earth and climate - it is imperative to seek an accurate and global model of paleogeography. However, owing to the incessant loss of oceanic lithosphere through subduction, the paleogeographic reconstruction of 'full-plates' (including oceanic lithosphere) becomes increasingly challenging with age. Prior to 150 Ma ???60{\%} of the lithosphere is missing and reconstructions are developed without explicit regard for oceanic lithosphere or plate tectonic principles; in effect, reflecting the earlier mobilistic paradigm of continental drift. Although these 'continental' reconstructions have been immensely useful, the next-generation of mantle models requires global plate kinematic descriptions with full-plate reconstructions. Moreover, in disregarding (or only loosely applying) plate tectonic rules, continental reconstructions fail to take advantage of a wealth of additional information in the form of practical constraints. Following a series of new developments, both in geodynamic theory and analytical tools, it is now feasible to construct full-plate models that lend themselves to testing by the wider Earth-science community. Such a model is presented here for the late Paleozoic (410-250 Ma) together with a review of the underlying data. Although we expect this model to be particularly useful for numerical mantle modeling, we hope that it will also serve as a general framework for understanding late Paleozoic tectonics, one on which future improvements can be built and further tested. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, some previous analyses of the 540-million-year Phanerozoic fossil record found a contrary relationship, with paleodiversity declining when the planet warms. These contradictory findings are hard to reconcile theoretically. We analyze marine invertebrate biodiversity patterns for the Phanerozoic Eon while controlling for sampling effort. This control appears to reverse the temporal association between temperature and biodiversity, such that taxonomic richness increases, not decreases, with temperature. Increasing temperatures also predict extinction and origination rates, alongside other abiotic and biotic predictor variables. These results undermine previous reports of a negative biodiversity-temperature relationship through time, which we attribute to paleontological sampling biases. Our findings suggest a convergence of global scale macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns for the biodiversity-temperature relationship.},

abstract = {The middle of the Cretaceous period (about 120 to 80 Myr ago) was a time of unusually warm polar temperatures, repeated reef-drowning in the tropics and a series of oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) that promoted both the widespread deposition of organic-carbon-rich marine sediments and high biological turnover. The cause of the warm temperatures is unproven but widely attributed to high levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. In contrast, there is no consensus on the climatic causes and effects of the OAEs, with both high biological productivity and ocean 'stagnation' being invoked as the cause of ocean anoxia. Here we show, using stable isotope records from multiple species of well-preserved foraminifera, that the thermal structure of surface waters in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean underwent pronounced variability about 100 Myr ago, with maximum sea surface temperatures 3-5 degrees C warmer than today. This variability culminated in a collapse of upper-ocean stratification during OAE-1d (the 'Breistroffer' event), a globally significant period of organic-carbon burial that we show to have fundamental, stratigraphically valuable, geochemical similarities to the main OAEs of the Mesozoic era. Our records are consistent with greenhouse forcing being responsible for the warm temperatures, but are inconsistent both with explanations for OAEs based on ocean stagnation, and with the traditional view (reviewed in ref. 12) that past warm periods were more stable than today's climate.},

abstract = {In the Wadi Wasit area (Central Oman Mountains), Dienerian breccias are widespread. These breccias consist mostly of Guadalupian reefal blocks, often dolomitised, and some rare small-sized blocks of lowermost Triassic bivalve-bearing limestones, A unique block, with a size of about 200 m3, including Permian and earliest Triassic faunas has been studied in detail. The so-called Wadi Wasit block consists of three major lithological units. A basal unstratified grey limestone is rich in various reef-building organisms (rugose corals, calcareous sponges, stromatoporoids) and has been dated as Middle Permian. It is disconformably overlain by well- and thin-bedded light grey to yellowish coloured limestones rich in molluscs. Two major lithologies (Coquina Limestone respectively Bioclastic Limestone unit) characterise the shelly limestones, their contact seems gradual. These two units are well-dated; they are of Griesbachian age and contain three conodont zones, the Parvus Zone, the Staeschei Zone and the Sosioensis Zone, and two ammonoid zones, the Ophiceras tibeticum Zone and an 'unnamed interval'. The third unit consists of a grey marly limestone containing Neospathodus kummeli (basal Dienerian). It is the first record of well-dated basal Triassic sediments in the Arabian Peninsula. The Coquina Limestone is dominated by the bivalve Promyalina with some Claraia and Eumorphotis. This bivalve association is interpreted as a pioneering opportunistic assemblage. Towards the top of the Bioclastic Limestone unit, the faunal diversity increases and contains probably more than 20 taxa of bivalves, microgastropods, crinoids, brachiopods, ammonoids, echinoid spines, ostracods and conodonts. The generic diversity of this biofacies exceeds by far any other Griesbachian assemblage known. Our data give new evidence for the geodynamical history for the distal carbonate shelf bordering the Hawasina Basin. A break in the sedimentation characterises the Late Permian. The basal Triassic shows a steady transgression and the breccias may record a distinct gravitational collapse of platform margins linked with sea-level low stand at the end of Induan time (late Dienerian-basal Smithian). ??13Ccarb isotopic analyses were performed and yield typical Permian values of around 4??? for the Reefal Limestone, with a strong negative shift across the Permian-Triassic boundary. During the Griesbachian values shift positively from 0.5 to 3.1??? parallel to an increase in faunal diversity and probably primary productivity. The detailed faunal analysis and the discovery of an unexpected diversity give us a new understanding of the recovery of the Early Triassic marine ecosystem. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In the euxinic waters of the NW' Black Sea shelf, tower-like carbonate build-ups up to several metres in height grow at sites of cold methane seepage. These structures are part of an unique microbial ecosystem that shows a considerable biodiversity and a remarkable degree of organization. The accretion of the build-ups is promoted by the growth of centimetre-sized, methane-filled spheres constructed by calcifying microbial mats. Progressive mineralization of these spheres involves the early precipitation of strongly luminescent high-Mg-calcite rich in iron sulphides, and closely interfingered aragonite phases that finally create the stable (mega-) thrombolithic fabric of the towers. Within the microbial mats, microorganisms occur in distinctive spatial arrangements. Major players among the microbial consortia are the archaea groups ANME-1 and ANME-2, Crenarchaeota, and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) of the Desulfosaricina/Desulfobacterium group. The intracellular precipitation of iron sulphides (greigite) by some of these bacteria, growing in close association with ANME-2, suggests iron cycling as an additional biogeochemical pathway involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM).},

abstract = {Lopingian (Late Permian) conodonts and stratigraphy in northwest and central Iran have become hotly debated issues recently. We here use a sample-population approach, to develop a high-resolution conodont biostratigraphic framework for the Lopingian of Iran based on a re-examination of collections studied by Sweet from the Kuh-e-Ali Bashi area, northwest Iran; samples from the Abadeh C section and a nearby Permian-Triassic boundary section in the Abadeh area; and on published data. Six Wuchiapingian conodont zones, the Clarkina dukouensis, C. asymmetrica, C. leveni, C. guangyuanensis, C. transcaucasica and C. orientalis zones, and eight Changhsingian conodont zones, the Clarkina wangi, C. subcarinata, C. changxingensis, C. bachmanni, C. nodosa, C. yini, C. abadehensis and C. hauschkei zones, are described and figured. Diagnoses of ontogenetic characteristics to population variations of all the zone-naming species are re-described based on a sample-population taxonomic concept. The high-resolution Lopingian conodont zonation in Iran is closely correlative with its counterpart in South China. However, slightly different evolutionary trends in Clarkina populations existed at the very end of the Changhsingian in Iran and South China. This reflects a geographical cline and/or facies dependence and endemism in Clarkina populations rather than stratigraphic incompleteness of sections in either Iran or South China.

abstract = {Late Eocene nearshore shallow-marine environments within the Bremer and western Eucla Basins of southern Western Australia were characterized by the thick deposition of spongolite and spiculite deposits. Epibenthic sponge communities dominated estuaries and topog. complex basin margin embayments-archipelagos, while cool-water carbonates with up to 10{\%} sponges accumulated in open-shelf environments. The transition from a biosiliceous to calcareous epibenthos was related to the degree of paleogeog. "protection". Within basement-protected embayments there was an offshore gradation from shoreface spongolite and pure spiculite to a muddy spiculite facies towards central embayment areas. Calcareous fossils are rare throughout embayment facies, but rapidly increase in more open outer archipelago areas. This depositional relationship occurred along 2000 km of the Late Eocene southern Australian coastline. Paleogeog. protection from strong currents acted in concert with: (1) a planar, low-gradient inland topog. with sluggish run-off, supplying fine-grained sediment, nutrients, and abundant dissolved silica; and (2) a microtidal setting, weak to moderate swells and opposing wind and Coriolis surface current forcing, which inhibited water exchange between embayments-estuaries and the open shelf. This situation led to an embayment water chem. that encouraged prolific sponge growth. Calcareous spiculites record the mixing front between these embayment waters and normal open-shelf waters supporting cool-water carbonates. [on SciFinder(R)]},

In conjunction with the end-Permian ecological crisis, approximately 250 million years ago, palynological data from East Greenland reveal some unanticipated patterns. We document the significant time lag between terrestrial ecosystem collapse and selective extinction among characteristic Late Permian plants. Furthermore, ecological crisis resulted in an initial increase in plant diversity, instead of a decrease. Paradoxically, these floral patterns correspond to a "dead zone" in the end-Permian faunal record, characterized by a paucity of marine invertebrate megafossils. The time-delayed, end-Permian plant extinctions resemble modeled "extinction debt" responses of multispecies metapopulations to progressive habitat destruction.},

abstract = {We report the sulfur and oxygen isotope composition of sulfate (??34SSO4 and ??18OSO4, respectively) in coexisting barite and carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), which we use to explore temporal variability in the marine sulfur cycle through the middle Cretaceous. The ??34SSO4 of marine barite tracks previously reported sulfur isotope data from the tropical Pacific. The ??18OSO4 of marine barite exhibits more rapid and larger isotopic excursions than the ??34SSO4 of marine barite; these excursions temporally coincide with Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs). Neither the ??34SSO4 nor the ??18OSO4 measured in marine barite resembles the ??34SSO4 or the ??18OSO4 measured in coexisting CAS. Culling our data set for elemental parameters suggestive of carbonate recrystallization (low [Sr] and high Mn/Sr) improves our record of ??18OSO4 in CAS in the Cretaceous. This suggests that the CAS proxy can be impacted by carbonate recrystallization in some marine sediments. A box model is used to explore the response of the ??34SSO4 and ??18OSO4 to different perturbations in the marine biogeochemical sulfur cycle. We conclude that the ??34SSO4 in the middle Cretaceous is likely responding to a change in the isotopic composition of pyrite being buried, coupled possibly with a change in riverine input. On the other hand, the ??18OSO4 is likely responding to rapid changes in the reoxidation pathway of sulfide, which we suggest may be due to anoxic versus euxinic conditions during different OAEs. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A reduction of the carbonate-carbon to organic-carbon export rain ratio during glacial times has been advanced to explain the glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations. This hypothesis is tested and implications for the dynamics of sedimentary carbonate preservation and dissolution are explored with a multi-box model (mbm) of the ocean carbon cycle, fully coupled to a new transient early diagenesis model (called medusa). A peak reduction of the rain ratio by 40{\%} at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was found to produce a net atmospheric p CO2 reduction of about 40 ppm. Changing shelf carbonate accumulation rates and continental weathering inputs produced a 55-60 ppm reduction. The combination of the two mechanisms generates a p CO2 change of 90-95 ppm, which compares well with the observed data. However, the resulting model sedimentary record does not conform to actual sedimentary records. The changes related to continental shelf processes and variable weathering flux depress the calcite saturation horizon (CSH) by about 1 km at the LGM; if rain ratio variations are also considered, that depression increases by another km. In addition to this large amplitude for the CSH, possibly due to the adopted box-model approach, the changing rain ratio also leads to transition zone changes in the model sedimentary record that are opposite in phase with data-based reconstructions. Realistic changes in the aragonite fraction of the carbonate rain were found to have only a minimal impact on atmospheric p CO2. Finally, chemical erosion of deep-sea sediment was shown to reduce the amplitude of variation of the sedimentary CCD by about 10-20{\%}. It may provide a mechanism to improve the model-data agreement. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These changes include a pronounced increase in the D/O peak height ratio accompanied by a narrowing of the D peak, a gradual decrease in the D/O peak width ratio, and a shift of both peaks toward higher wave numbers. Second-order Raman peaks, though less intensive, also show systematic peak shifting as a function of Ro.

abstract = {The late Triassic period is recognized as one of the five major mass extinctions in the fossil record. All these important intervals in earth history are associated with excursions in C-isotope records thought to have been caused by perturbations in the global carbon cycle. The nature and causes of C-isotopic events across the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) transition however, are poorly understood. We present several new high resolution organic C-isotope records from the Eiberg Basin, Austria, including the proposed Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Jurassic. The Triassic-Jurassic boundary interval in these records is characterized by the initial and main negative organic carbon isotope excursions (CIE) of up to 8‰. The initial and main CIEs are biostratigraphically constrained by first and last occurrences of boundary defining macro- and microfossils (e.g. ammonites). High resolution C-isotope records appear to be an excellent correlation proxy for this period in the Eiberg Basin. Pyrolysis analysis demonstrates increased Hydrogen Index (HI) values for organic matter coinciding with the initial CIE. Terrestrial organic matter influx and mass occurrences of green algae remains may have influenced the C-isotope composition of the sedimentary organic matter. This may have contributed to the extreme amplitude of the initial CIE in the Eiberg Basin. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A 1 m thick carbonate crust, layered and commonly domal, caps crinoidal limestones on reef complexes of the top Permian Changxing Formation in the Huaying Mountains, eastern Sichuan, China. The crust's stratigraphic level lies at a sharp change in facies, and is overlain by poorly fossiliferous laminated micrites and shales of the Lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation. The crust therefore appears to coincide with the end-Permian extinction event, although the dating of the strata is currently imprecise. The crust is composed mostly of digitate carbonate, locally thrombolitic, with remnant lobate fabric, and resembles microbialites, but is mostly recrystallised and a microbial origin is unconfirmed. It is enclosed in micrite with pyrite crystals, ostracode and other shell debris. The crust is absent from interreef areas. Previous interpretations of karstification and calcrete formation are not upheld, and the facies were deposited under water. Overlying sediments are low energy, with abundant ferroan calcite and pyrite, reflecting anoxia associated with rising sea level. Various interpretations of the crust are possible: (1) it was organic, and microbia grew preferentially on topographic highs of reef tops; (2) microbia were a disaster biota in the absence of grazers, (3) microbia took advantage of favourable conditions for calcification, associated with a rapidly rising environmental-CO2 content during the Late Permian; (4) the crust was an inorganic precipitate associated with CO2-rich water. Microbial crusts are rare after the Cambrian, but whether this crust is organic or not, its presence in these strata reinforces the view that oceanic-atmospheric conditions in the Permian-Triassic boundary interval were unusual.

These results permit comparison with widely studied, coeval sections in Low Latitudes (LL) and IL. Oxygen isotope ratios of well-preserved shell materials indicate a partially pronounced Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradient in the Permian, whereas for the Triassic no indication of cold climates in the southern HL is found. The Late Jurassic of New Zealand is characterized by a slight warming in the Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian and a subsequent cooling trend in the Tithonian. Systematic variations in the ??13C values of southern HL samples are in concert with those from LL sections and confirm the global nature of the carbon isotope signature and changes in the long-term carbon cycle reported earlier.Systematic changes of Sr/Ca ratios in Late Triassic brachiopods, falling from 1.19. mmol/mol in the Oretian (early Norian) to 0.67. mmol/mol in the Warepan (late Norian) and subsequently increasing to 1.10. mmol/mol in the Otapirian ({\~{}}.

Also Sr/Ca ratios of Late Jurassic belemnite genera Belemnopsis and Hibolithes show synchronous changes in composition that may be attributed to secular variations in the seawater Sr/Ca ratio.

abstract = {Microbial activity has been invoked to explain anomalous oxygen isotope compositions of phosphate mineral deposits as well as fossil biogenic apatite. Results of laboratory experiments on enzyme-mediated reactions of phosphate and microbially mediated degradation of organic matter, an important mechanism for the regeneration of dissolved phosphate in modern porewaters, demonstrate that significant exchange of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water accompanies the hydrolytic cleavage of organically bound phosphate as well as the metabolism of inorganic orthophosphate. Evaluation of the oxygen isotope systematics of microbially mediated reactions of phosphate suggests that oxygen isotope exchange between phosphate and water mediated by bacteria is governed by equilibrium rather than kinetic factors. Under certain conditions, the microbially mediated exchange appears to result in complete re-equilibration of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water and in other instances equilibrium exchange may be masked by inheritance of phosphate-oxygen from the organic substrate. Analogous microbial processes in natural sediments may be important in; the release of dissolved phosphate to pore fluids, precipitation of authigenic apatite, and in the diagenetic alteration of phosphorite deposits and biogenic apatite. These results have important implications for paleoclimatological and paleoenvironmental studies in which oxygen isotope ratios of biogenic phosphate are used as paleotemperature indicators, as well as for studies employing phosphate oxygen isotopes as a tracer of P transport and cycling in the environment.

abstract = {In the Wadi Wasit area (Central Oman Mountains), Dienerian breccias are widespread. These breccias consist mostly of Guadalupian reefal blocks, often dolomitised, and some rare small-sized blocks of lowermost Triassic bivalve-bearing limestones. A unique block, with a size of about 200 m(3), including Permian and earliest Triassic faunas has been studied in detail. The so-called Wadi Wasit block consists of three major lithological units. A basal unstratified grey limestone is rich in various reef-building organisms (rugose corals, calcareous sponges, stromatoporoids) and has been dated as Middle Permian. It is disconformably overlain by well- and thin-bedded light grey to yellowish coloured limestones rich in molluscs. Two major lithologies (Coquina Limestone respectively Bioclastic Limestone unit) characterise the shelly limestones, their contact seems gradual. These two units are well-dated; they are of Griesbachian age and contain three conodont zones, the Parvus Zone, the Staeschei Zone and the Sosioensis Zone, and two ammonoid zones, the Ophiceras tibeticum Zone and an 'unnamed interval'. The third unit consists of a grey marly limestone containing Neospathodus kummeli (basal Dienerian). It is the first record of well-dated basal Triassic sediments in the Arabian Peninsula. The Coquina Limestone is dominated by the bivalve Promyalina with some Claraia and Eumorphotis. This bivalve association is interpreted as a pioneering opportunistic assemblage. Towards the top of the Bioclastic Limestone unit, the faunal diversity increases and contains probably more than 20 taxa of bivalves, microgastropods, crinoids, brachiopods, ammonoids, echinoid spines, ostracods and conodonts. The generic diversity of this biofacies exceeds by far any other Griesbachian assemblage known. Our data give new evidence for the geodynamical history for the distal carbonate shelf bordering the Hawasina Basin. A break in the sedimentation characterises the Late Permian. The basal Triassic shows a steady transgression and the breccias may record a distinct gravitational collapse of platform margins linked with sea-level low stand at the end of Induan time (late Dienerian-basal Smithian). delta(13)C(carb) isotopic analyses were performed and yield typical Permian values of around 4parts per thousand for the Reefal Limestone, with a strong negative shift across the Permian-Triassic boundary. During the Griesbachian values shift positively from 0.5 to 3.1parts per thousand parallel to an increase in faunal diversity and probably primary productivity. The detailed faunal analysis and the discovery of an unexpected diversity give,us a new understanding of the recovery of the Early Triassic marine ecosystem.

abstract = {Wide geographic range is generally thought to buffer taxa against extinction, but the strength of this effect has not been investigated for the great majority of the fossil record. Although the majority of genus extinctions have occurred between major mass extinctions, little is known about extinction selectivity regimes during these "background" intervals. Consequently, the question of whether selectivity regimes differ between background and mass extinctions is largely unresolved. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the selectivity of genus survivorship with respect to geographic range by using a global database of fossil benthic marine invertebrates spanning the Cambrian through the Neogene periods, an interval of approximately 500 My. Our results show that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship for the great majority of Phanerozoic time. Moreover, the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera. However, mass extinctions and several second-order extinction events exhibit less geographic range selectivity than predicted by range alone. Widespread environmental disturbance can explain the reduced association between geographic range and extinction risk by simultaneously affecting genera with similar ecological and physiological characteristics on global scales. Although factors other than geographic range have certainly affected extinction risk during many intervals, geographic range is likely the most consistently significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record.},

abstract = {A population of 169 Permian articulate brachiopod shells was analysed for their Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. 51 of these, characterised as well preserved and stratigraphically well defined, are utilized for delineation of the Permian seawater strontium isotope trend. The Sr-87/Sr-86 curve shows values of about 0.7080 in the lowermost Permian (Asselian), followed by a gradual decline to 0.70685 in the Capitanian and a minor rise in the Dzhulfian and lower Dorashamian to values of 0.70715 just below the Permian-Triassic boundary. The Early Permian decrease in the strontium isotope curve that commences in the early Sakmarian is coincident with the advancing deglaciation of the Gondwana and with the increased aridity in large parts of the Pangaea. These factors may have led to a reduced continental weathering of Rb-rich silicate rocks, and thus to the decline in seawater Sr-87/Sr-86. Starting with the Artinskian, the opening of the Neotethys and the associated widespread basaltic volcanism supplied low radiogenic strontium to seawater from an enhanced hydrothermal flux. In the Capitanian, basaltic volcanism in the entire Palaeotethys ceased and this may have been the reason for a slightly more radiogenic, seawater isotopic composition during the Lopingian. Higher input of riverine Sr due to expansion of humid areas may have been a contributory factor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two hundred sixty-four delta(18)O and delta(13)C values of Permian articulate brachiopod shells were analyzed and 81 of these values were characterized as well preserved and biostratigraphically well defined. These were then utilized for construction of baseline oxygen and carbon isotope curves for the Permian interval. In addition, 21 delta(13)C whole rock values are reported for the Wordian and Capitanian. The early Permian, Asselian to Artinskian, times are characterized by similar to 2.5 parts per thousand decrease in oxygen isotope values, from similar to-0.7 parts per thousand to -3.3 parts per thousand (V-PDB). This is attributed to a similar to 4-7 degrees C increase in temperature in the Southern Urals, concomitant with the retreat of the Permo-Carboniferous ice sheets and return of the O-18-depleted melt water into the oceans. The Late Permian samples from Iran (Jolfa at Kuh-e-Ali-Bashi) and China (Meishan) yield delta(18)O values, and presumably temperatures, similar to those that followed the termination of the large-scale glaciation in the Lower Permian. In between, the upper Kungurian to Capitanian samples from the Delaware Basin (Guadalupe Mountains) are enriched in O-18, at -1.5 parts per thousand to -3 parts per thousand. We have no definitive explanation for these data, but tentatively suggest that the "anomaly" can potentially be a result of evaporative enrichment of seawater in O-18, due to intracratonic, and setting of the basin. The O-18-enriched nature of the Zechstein samples (-1.2 parts per thousand to +2.5 parts per thousand), on the other hand, is in all probability a reflection of the high evaporation rates in the Zechstein sea. The Permian interval is characterized by a relatively constant delta(13)C, at about 4 parts per thousand. The exceptions are again the brachiopods from the Delaware Basin (Guadalupe Mountains), which show similar to 1.6 parts per thousand increase in the Guadalupian, to values of up to 5.9 parts per thousand in the Wordian. A tentative explanation, as in the case of oxygen, is based on the proposition that the semi-enclosed Delaware Basin was likely stratified, with sequestration of the C-13-depleted carbon to the deeper water layers and a complementary C-13 enrichment in the upper oxygenated layer. The coeval open ocean water DIC may have been similar to that of the remainder of the Permian interval, at similar to 4 parts per thousand, as indicated by whole rock carbonate samples from Oman, Sicily, and Iran. In the latest Permian, the trend mimics the well-known delta(13)C drop at the Permian/Triassic boundary. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The early diagenesis of sulfur was assessed in four short sediment cores on the continental shelf off southeastern Brazil that were deposited under the influence of an upwelling tropical system. This tropical upwelling area allows a direct focus on the coupled roles of hydrodynamic- and bioturbation-driven influences on sulfate reduction, sulfide re-oxidation and corresponding stable sulfur isotope signal formation. Under the depositional conditions of Cabo Frio, the degree of reactive iron pyritization was limited by both dissolved sulfide availability and pyrite oxidation events. Textural analyses of pyrite framboids provide evidence of re-oxidation processes, reflecting dynamic redox conditions in the sediments. The isotope composition of pore-water sulfate remained close to the modern seawater value, but very light stable sulfur isotope ratios (S-34/S-32) of chromium reducible sulfur (essentially pyrite) are found that reflect intense bioturbation-induced sulfur re-cycling. The sulfur isotope signatures developing in these tropical upwelling sites are similar to those of modern euxinic systems, although they are caused by a superimposition of sulfate reduction and an intense oxidative sulfur cycle.},

abstract = {The stability of magnesian calcites was reexamined, and new results are presented for 28 natural inorganic, 12 biogenic, and 32 synthetic magnesian calcites. The magnesian calcite solid-solutions were separated into two groups on the basis of differences in stoichiometric solubility and other physical and chemical properties. Group I consists of solids of mainly metamorphic and hydrothermal origin, synthetic calcites prepared at high temperatures and pressures, and synthetic solids prepared at low temperature and very low calcite supersaturations (??calcite ??? 1.5) from artificial sea water or NaClMgCl2CaCl2 solutions. Group I solids are essentially binary s of CaCO2 and MgCO2, and are thought to be relatively free of structural defects. Group II solid-solutions are of either biogenic origin or are synthetic magnesian calcites and protodolomites (0-20 and ??? 45 mole percent MgCO3) prepared at high calcite supersaturations (??calcite??? 3) from NaClNa2SO4MgCl2CaCl2 or NaClMgCl2CaCl2 solutions. Group II solid-solutions are treated as massively defective solids. The defects include substitution foreign ions (Na+ and SO42-) in the magnesian calcite lattice (point defects) and dislocations ({\~{}}2 ?? 109 cm-2). Within each group, the excess free energy of mixing, GE, is described by the mixing model ge = X(1- x)[A0 + A1(2x - 1)], where x is the mole fraction of the end-member Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3 in the solid-solution. The values of A0 and A1 for Group I and II solids were evaluated at 25??C. The equilibrium constants of all the solids are closely described by the equation ln Kx = x(1-x) RT[A0 + A1(2x- 1)]+ (1 - x) ln [KC(1- x)]+ x ln (KDx), where KC and KD are the equilibrium constants of calcite and Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3. Group I magnesian calcites were modeled as sub-regular solid-solutions between calcite and dolomite, and between calcite and "disordered dolomite". Both models yield almost identical equilibrium constants for these magnesian calcites. The Group II magnesian calcites were modeled as sub-regular solid-solutions between defective calcite and protodolomite. Group I and II solid-solutions differ significantly in stability. The rate of crystal growth and the chemical composition of the aqueous solutions from which the solids were formed are the main factors controlling stoichiometric solubility of the magnesian calcites and the density of crystal defects. The literature on the occurrence and behavior of magnesian calcites in sea water and other aqueous solutions is also examined. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Abstract. Quaternary sea level fluctuations have greatly affected the sediment budgets of the continental shelves. Previous studies suggested that this caused a considerable increase in the net loss of shelf sediments. Since sediment accumulation and erosion are closely tied to the formation and re-oxidation of pyrite, we use a high-resolution record of sulfur isotope ratios (34S / 32S) of marine sulfate to evaluate the implications of the so-called "shelf sediment offloading" on the global sulfur cycle. Modeling of our $\delta$34S record suggests that erosion during sea level lowstands was only partly compensated by increased sedimentation during times of rising sea level and sea level highstands. Furthermore, our data suggests that shelf systems reached a new equilibrium state about 700 ka, which considerably slowed or terminated shelf sediment offloading.},

abstract = {New ichnological data from the Lower Triassic Werfen Formation (Dolomites, Italy) revealed an unexpectedly diverse and complex ichnofauna in mixed siliclastic–carbonate shelf sediments of the western tropical Tethys shortly after the end-Permian mass extinction event. Common elements are Thalassinoides, Palaeophycus and Planolites. Other associated ichnogenera include Spongeliomorpha, Rhizocorallium, Lockeia, Catenichnus, Helminthopsis, and Taenidium. One structure is tentatively determined as Curvolithus. Biostratigraphic data (conodonts and bivalves) of the trace fossil interval (lower Seis/Siusi Member) suggest a late Griesbachian age, less than 1 Ma after the end-Permian mass extinction event. Similarly diverse ichnofossil communities from this time interval have recently been described from the Boreal Realm, but this is the first record of a diverse Griesbachian ichnoassemblage from the tropics, indicating that the early recovery of trace fossil producers was not latitudinally restricted, as previously proposed. Accordingly, relatively advanced recovery stages were reached on a global scale much earlier than the Spathian as is commonly acknowledged. The early and interregional peak in ichnofaunal recovery implies subsequent ecological setbacks in post-Griesbachian times that explain the overall delay of benthic recovery until the Spathian. Rather than persistent catastrophic conditions during the Griesbachian, a global and synchronous succession of crises and relaxation phases after the Griesbachian is proposed as an explanatory model for the recovery pattern of benthic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The precise interpretation of environmental sulfur isotope records requires a quantitative understanding of the biochemical controls on sulfur isotope fractionation by the principle isotope-fractionating process within the S cycle, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR). Here we provide the only direct observation of the major ((34)S/(32)S) and minor ((33)S/(32)S, (36)S/(32)S) sulfur isotope fractionations imparted by a central enzyme in the energy metabolism of sulfate reducers, dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB). Results from in vitro sulfite reduction experiments allow us to calculate the in vitro DsrAB isotope effect in (34)S/(32)S (hereafter, [Formula: see text]) to be 15.3 ± 2‰, 2$\sigma$. The accompanying minor isotope effect in (33)S, described as [Formula: see text], is calculated to be 0.5150 ± 0.0012, 2$\sigma$. These observations facilitate a rigorous evaluation of the isotopic fractionation associated with the dissimilatory MSR pathway, as well as of the environmental variables that govern the overall magnitude of fractionation by natural communities of sulfate reducers. The isotope effect induced by DsrAB upon sulfite reduction is a factor of 0.3-0.6 times prior indirect estimates, which have ranged from 25 to 53‰ in (34)$\epsilon$DsrAB. The minor isotope fractionation observed from DsrAB is consistent with a kinetic or equilibrium effect. Our in vitro constraints on the magnitude of [Formula: see text] is similar to the median value of experimental observations compiled from all known published work, where (34)$\epsilon$ r-p = 16.1‰ (r-p indicates reactant vs. product, n = 648). This value closely matches those of MSR operating at high sulfate reduction rates in both laboratory chemostat experiments ([Formula: see text] 17.3 ± 1.5‰, 2$\sigma$) and in modern marine sediments ([Formula: see text] 17.3 ± 3.8‰). Targeting the direct isotopic consequences of a specific enzymatic processes is a fundamental step toward a biochemical foundation for reinterpreting the biogeochemical and geobiological sulfur isotope records in modern and ancient environments.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that in a number of places such as Greece, Turkey, the Central Pamirs, and Thailand Neo-Tethys may have opened as a back-arc basin above a Palaeo-Tethyan subduction zone. The purpose of this paper is to test a similar suggestion for Oman. I review the late Palaeozoic to end-Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the Middle Eastern Tethysides in terms of a new tectonic model, whose main tenet is to regard the late Palaeozoic to Late Triassic basements of the Pontide/Dzirula/Adzharia-Trialeti/Arvin-Karabagh/Sanandaj -- Sirjan zones collectively as a NNE-facing Palaeo-Tethyan magmatic arc, here named the Podataksasi arc' (or zone') whose Jurassic--Cretaceous movement with respect to Eurasia was responsible for much of the coeval deformation in Iran and Transcaucasia. The late Palaeozoic deformation of the Omani basement is regarded as a part of the retroarc fold and thrust belt of this arc and therefore independent of the Hercynides in Europe and NW Africa. The arc may have been compressional in late Carboniferous to possibly early Permian time and turned extensional in the earlier middle Permian. As a result, it rifted from NE Gondwana-Land, opening, successively, the Hawasina basin in the middle Permian and the main Neo-Tethyan ocean in the Triassic, together forming the Omani Neo-Tethyan back-arc basin complex'. Nearly all of the tectonic and magmatic characteristics of this basin complex are compatible with a back-arc basin interpretation, except perhaps the anomalously far inland location of the initial rift axis. A rather complete Mesozoic tectonic history of the entire Middle Eastern Tethysides is given to justify the model presented.},

abstract = {Significantly different Guadalupian-Late Triassic patterns are observed in the evolution of attached and isolated carbonate platforms of the southwestern Tethys (Oman Mountains). Close to the rim of the attached Arabian platform, carbonates of the Saiq and Mahil Formations reveal an almost complete Permian-Triassic sedimentary record. Guadalupian-Changhsingian 3rd order sequences consist of fossiliferous transgressive systems tracts and monotonous highstand systems tracts with mud/wackestone and coral bafflestone. The youngest Changhsingian beds are bioturbated floatstone with crinoids, sponges and bryozoans. All sediments indicate a healthy, tropical carbonate production. Above, a unique facies change begins with a pyrite-encrusted omission surface. Greenish mudstone rich in authigenic pyrite infills the relief of the unconformity and is overlain by clastic sediment and by laminated, microbialite-bearing carbonate. Unfossiliferous sediments and seafloor cements indicate a change in carbonate production towards abiotic processes. Prevailing anoxic conditions were interrupted by seven oxic event beds, as indicated either by low-diversity and small-sized ichnotaxa or by shell beds with low-diversity bivalve and crinoid assemblages. By comparison with published data, the described sedimentary sequence can be assigned to the Changhsingian-earliest Griesbachian. Beginning probably with the Anisian, bioturbated Griesbachian-Dienerian recovery period and the unconformity below to the latest grain-supported sediment textures mark the return to biogenic tropical carbonate production under oxic conditions. The Middle-Late Triassic carbonate platform consists of stacked high-frequency shallowing upward cycles. By contrast, carbonate production of Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms was discontinuous and interrupted by a large gap. Guadalupian deposits of the Al Jil Formation consist of bioclastic limestone typical of a tropical carbonate production. The uppermost bed, an impoverished bioclastic packstone capped by an unconformity, marks the onset of platform drowning which resulted from the end-Guadalupian mass extinction. Above, a polymict breccia witnessed rift pulses of the Neo-Tethys. The overlying pelagic mud- and packstone contains radiolarians and rare foraminifera of Lopingian age, and overlying microbialites. In the Carnian, tropical shallow-water carbonate production restarted with a low-relief platform and culminated in a Norian-Rhaetian reef-rimmed platform. Stacked Lofer cycles dominated the inner platform of Jebel Kawr (Misfah Formation). We here propose a differential onset and severity of the Late Permian mass extinctions for carbonate platforms. On the Arabian Plate, tropical carbonate production collapsed after the end-Lopingian mass extinction and was replaced by microbialites and sea-floor cements during the earliest Triassic. After approximately six million years, tropical shallow-water carbonate production resumed in the Middle Triassic. Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms drowned shortly after the end-Guadalupian mass extinction and did not recover before the Late Triassic. Absence of shallow-water limestone suggests that carbonate production of isolated platforms ceased for about 30 million years, a period exceeding the recovery of most marine ecosystems.

abstract = {Stable isotope analyses of carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb) and total organic carbon (TOC; $\delta$13Corg), together with geochemical analyses of 54 major, minor, and trace elements and magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on whole rock samples of the undisturbed Permian–Triassic (P/Tr) limestone boundary sequence in the Idrijca Valley (W. Slovenia). At the P/Tr boundary, there is a 0.8-cm thick clayey marl layer (PTB) showing a characteristic magnetic susceptibility pulse and considerable enrichment in most major, minor, and trace elements. The P/Tr transition is characterized by (1) an abrupt decrease in sedimentation rate from 32 to 5 cm/100 ka, (2) a well known prominent negative excursion of $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg, reflecting global perturbations in the carbon cycle, and (3) the drastic disappearance of typically Upper Permian marine fauna.  Although the shape of the $\delta$13Ccarb curve indicates gradual long-term change across the P/Tr boundary, the sharp negative $\delta$13Corg anomaly within an interval from 30 cm below to 6 cm above the boundary suggests an interruption of those gradual processes.  Our observations for selected redox sensitive elements (Mo, U, V and Zn), abundances for organic carbon and sulphur and the rare earth elements (REE) distribution in the boundary sequence, as well as the shape of the Ce/Ce* curve suggest that oceanic anoxia was typical of the Upper Permian, and that the transition to oxygenated conditions occurred at the P/Tr boundary. Oxygenation at the P/Tr transition is coincidental with the terminal phase of the Upper Permian marine regression. The shape of the Ce/Ce* curve indicates that the redox environmental conditions changed again in the earliest Triassic, resulting once more in oxygen deficient conditions. },

Taxa that have less than or equal to 15 {\%} stratigraphic abundance (percent of sample intervals in which a taxon occurs) show last occurrences well before that level, whereas taxa,vith more complete records tend to disappear at or close to that level. These results are in agreement with simulations for abrupt extinctions, as opposed to gradual or steplike extinction scenarios, and support predictions of the Signor-Lipps effect, that errors in the end points of biostratigraphic ranges can produce range truncations and apparent gradual decline preceding a sudden extinction boundary. On the basis of estimated sedimentation rates for the Italian sections, the end-Permian extinctions could have been very sudden (less than or equal to 30 k.y.), and the disappearance of most latest Permian foraminifers was most likely coincident with a world wide ecological stress event, identified by a global negative delta(13)C anomaly that Occurs in Italy near the base or within the time-transgressive Tesero horizon.},

abstract = {The marine sulfur cycle is intimately linked to global carbon fluxes, atmospheric composition, and climate, yet relatively little is known about how it responded to the end-Permian biocrisis, the largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic. Here, we analyze carbonate-associated-sulfate (CAS) from three Permo–Triassic sections in South China in order to document the behavior of the C–S cycle and its relationship to marine environmental changes during the mass extinction and its aftermath. We find that $\delta$34SCAS varied from +9‰ to +44‰ at rates up to 100‰Myr−1 during the Griesbachian–Smithian substages of the Early Triassic. We model the marine sulfur cycle to demonstrate that such rapid variation required drawdown of seawater sulfate concentrations to ⩽4mM and a reduction in its residence time to ⩽200kyr. This shorter residence time resulted in positive covariation with $\delta$13Ccarb due to strong coupling of the organic carbon and pyrite burial fluxes. Carbon and sulfur isotopic shifts were associated with contemporaneous changes in climate, marine productivity, and microbial sulfate reduction rates, with negative shifts in $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$34SCAS linked to warming, decreased productivity, and reduced sulfate reduction. Sustained cooling during the Spathian re-invigorated oceanic overturning circulation, reduced marine anoxia, and limited pyrite burial. As seawater sulfate built to higher concentrations during the Spathian, the coupling of the marine C and S cycles came to an end and a general amelioration of marine environmental conditions set the stage for a recovery of invertebrate faunas. Variation in seawater sulfate during the Early Triassic was probably controlled by climate change, possibly linked to major eruptive phases of the Siberian Traps.},

abstract = {A sequential extraction method (BASEX) was developed to determine the different Ba fractions in sediments. Calibration of BASEX with pure barite and a home-made mixed mineral standard showed that barite is separated from all other major Ba containing mineral phases, such as clay minerals and Fe and Mn oxides. This method permits the direct determination of sedimentary barite content and of the Ba/Al ratio of clay, and is, therefore, a useful tool in palaeoclimatic studies. Application of BASEX to eastern Mediterranean sediments, including sapropel S1, revealed that the enrichment in Ba concentrations observed in this sapropel consists predominantly of barite. The relationship of barite-Ba with organic carbon in sapropel S1 sediments appears to be independent of water depth, of organic matter fluxes and of the sedimentation rate for cores ranging from 2150 to 3300 m water depth. Apparently, organic carbon remineralisation has been virtually absent in the water column deeper than 2150 m. This might have been caused by suboxic to anoxic conditions present in the deep eastern Mediterranean basin during the formation of sapropel S1. Because of the constant relationship between barite and organic carbon in sapropelic sediments, we suggest that the barite content can be used to quantify the initial organic carbon content of the sediment in the oxidised sapropel interval. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This investigation focuses on the original mineralogy of Wuchiapingian (Late Permian) to Induan (Early Triassic) strata of the Shahreza section of Iran to understand changes in marine carbonate system during this transition. Aragonitic carbonates precipitated during the early part of the Wuchiapingian, gradually changing to calcite during the middle part of the Wuchiapingian and continuing through the Changhsingian. Carbonate precipitation ceased during the latest Changhsingian at the end-Permian Event Horizon (EH). A sharp reversal back to aragonite precipitation occurred in the Early Triassic. These changes are interpreted as the ocean's response to a changing climate. This study proposes three types of seawater for the Late Permian to Early Triassic interval. Normal (Anahita-type) seawater during the Late Permian was hospitable to life and supported a highly active carbonate factory. Acidic (Jahi-type) seawater during the PTB transition was acidic and hostile to life, slowing or halting carbonate production. Alkaline (Amordad-type) seawater during the Early Triassic was life-nurturing and supported an active carbonate factory. It sustained life until a normal (Anahita-type) seawater could be re-established. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The end Permian negative [delta]13C excursion is well known but its cause and chronology are still in question. In an attempt to decipher the timing and reasons for this strong decrease, we established high-resolution sedimentological, biostratigraphical and carbonate carbon isotopic studies in four sections in Iran (Abadeh, Shareeza, Zal and Djulfa) and two in Oman (Wadi Sahtan). The position of the sections on two different margins of the Neotethys has allowed us to distinguish between local and global signals. This high-resolution chemostratigraphy, tested for isochrony on the basis of an updated high-resolution conodont and ammonoid biostratigraphy, allows the discrimination of nine successive isotopic events (IE 0-8) for the Permian-Triassic Boundary Interval (PTBI). The negative excursion of the PTBI has been separated into four distinct parts. A first drop (IE 0) occurs in the Late Wuchiapingian with an amplitude of around 1.3[per mille sign]. A second decrease begins (IE 1-2) at the base of the Dzhulfites ammonoid beds (Changhsingian) and continues gradually until the extinction event (top jolfensis conodont interval, without important second-order variations. Its amplitude varies between 1.5[per mille sign] and 2.8[per mille sign] and its duration has been estimated around 2.2 Ma, revealing a non-catastrophic phenomenon. The lower meishanensis-praeparvus conodont Zone records stationary to slightly increasing values (IE 3). The interval of the curve after the extinction event, between the upper meishanensis-praeparvus Zone and the base of the I. isarcica Zone, records numerous second-order variations (IE 4-7). Its amplitude is of 1.2-3.1[per mille sign]. These second-order variations are correlatable in Iran but with some uncertainty with Oman. Poor correlation of these small peaks with others published sections might be due to a higher sensitivity to local perturbations and a lower buffer capacity of the whole ocean. We assume that the processes leading to the extinction event also caused the isotopic decrease before the extinction level with a maximal amplitude of only 2.8[per mille sign]. This allows consideration of some possible mechanisms that were rejected as unrealistic to cause a 4-6[per mille sign] excursion.},

The time curve of the sulfur isotope ratios of the sedimentary sulfate reservoir was used to drive the model back to the beginning of Cambrian time (600 million years ago), producing the reservoir sizes and isotope values and material fluxes of the carbon-sulfur system. The predicted values of carbon isotope ratios of the carbonate reservoir agree well with observed values, showing that the model is basically sound. Some general conclusions from this success are (i) material flux rates in the carbon-oxygen-sulfur system of the geologic past (averaged over tens of millions of years) lie within about a factor of 2 of Recent rates. (ii) The oxidation-reduction balances of Phanerozoic time were dominated by reciprocal relationships between carbon and sulfur compounds. (iii) The rate of production of atmospheric oxygen by storage in sediments of organic carbon of photosynthetic origin increased from the Cambrian Period to the Permian Period and declined somewhat from the Permian Period to the Present. (iv) The storage of oxygen in oxidized sulfur compounds kept pace (within the limits of the data) with oxygen production. (v) Transfer of oxygen from CO(2) to SO(4) from the Cambrian to the Permian Period was several times the Recent free oxygen content of the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The end of the Permian period is marked by global warming and the biggest known mass extinction on Earth. The crisis is commonly attributed to the formation of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province although the causal mechanisms remain disputed. We show that heating of Tunguska Basin sediments by the ascending magma played a key role in triggering the crisis. Our conclusions are based on extensive field work in Siberia ireichown 2004 and 2006. Heating of organic-rich shale and petroleum bearing evaporites around sill intrusions led to greenhouse gas and halocarbon generation in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and atmospheric ozone depletion. Basin scale gas production potential estimates show that metamorphism of organic matter and petroleum could have generated {\textgreater} 100,000 Gt CO2. The gases were released to the end-Permian atmosphere partly through spectacular pipe structures with kilometre-sized craters. Dating of a sill intrusion by the U-Pb method shows that the gas release occurred at 252.0 +/- 0.4 million years ago, overlapping in time with the end-Permian global warming and mass extinction. Heating experiments to 275 degrees C on petroleum-bearing rock salt from Siberia suggests that methyl chloride and methyl bromide were significant components of the erupted gases. The results indicate that global warming and ozone depletion were the two main drivers for the end-Permian environmental crisis. We demonstrate that the composition of the heated sedimentary rocks below the flood basalts is the most important factor in controlling whether a Large Igneous Provinces causes an environmental crisis or not. We propose that a similar mechanism could have been responsible for the Triassic-Jurassic (similar to 200 Ma) global warming and mass extinction, based on the presence of thick sill intrusions in the evaporite deposits of the Amazon Basin in Brazil.

abstract = {Permian waning of the low-latitude Alleghenian/Variscan/Hercynian orogenesis led to a long collisional orogeny gap that cut down the availability of chemically wwignall 2007 how badeatherable fresh silicate rock resulting in a high-CO2 atmosphere and global warming. The correspondingly reduced delivery of nutrients to the biosphere caused further increases in CO2 and warming. Melting of polar ice curtailed sinking of O2- and nutrient-rich cold brines while pole-to-equator thermal gradients weakened. Wind shear and associated wind-driven upwelling lessened, further diminishing productivity and carbon burial. As the Earth warmed, dry climates expanded to mid-latitudes, causing latitudinal expansion of the Ferrel circulation cell at the expense of the polar cell. Increased coastal evaporation generated O2- and nutrient-deficient warm saline bottom water (WSBW) and delivered it to a weakly circulating deep ocean. Warm, deep currents delivered ever more heat to high latitudes until polar sinking of cold water was replaced by upwelling WSBW. With the loss of polar sinking, the ocean was rapidly filled with WSBW that became increasingly anoxic and finally euxinic by the end of the Permian. Rapid incursion of WSBW could have produced {\~{}}20 m of thermal expansion of the oceans, generating the well-documented marine transgression that flooded embayments in dry, hot Pangaean mid-latitudes. The flooding further increased WSBW production and anoxia, and brought that anoxic water onto the shelves. Release of CO2 from the Siberian traps and methane from clathrates below the warming ocean bottom sharply enhanced the already strong greenhouse. Increasingly frequent and powerful cyclonic storms mined upwelling high-latitude heat and released it to the atmosphere. That heat, trapped by overlying clouds of its own making, suggests complete breakdown of the dry polar cell. Resulting rapid and intense polar warming caused or contributed to extinction of the remaining latest Permian coal forests that could not migrate any farther poleward because of light limitations. Loss of water stored by the forests led to aquifer drainage, adding another {\~{}}5 m to the transgression. Non-peat-forming vegetation survived at the newly moist poles. Climate feedback from the coal-forest extinction further intensified warmth, contributing to delayed biotic recovery that generally did not begin until mid-Triassic, but appears to have resumed first at high latitudes late in the Early Triassic. Current quantitative models fail to generate high-latitude warmth and so do not produce the chain of events we outline in this paper. Future quantitative modeling addressing factors such as polar cloudiness, increased poleward heat transport by deep water and its upwelling by cyclonic storms, and sustainable mid-latitude sinking of warm brines to promote anoxia, warming, and thermal expansion of deep water may more closely simulate conditions indicated by geological and paleontological data.},

abstract = {The elemental composition of phytoplankton is a fusion of the evolutionary history of the host and plastid, resulting in differences in genetic constraints and selection pressures associated with environmental conditions. The evolutionary inheritance hypothesis predicts similarities in elemental composition within related taxonomic lineages of phytoplankton. To test this hypothesis, we measured the elemental composition (C, N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cd and Mo) of 14 phytoplankton species and combined these with published data from 15 more species from both marine and freshwater environments grown under nutrient-replete conditions. The largest differences in the elemental profiles of the species distinguish between the prokaryotic Cyanophyta and primary endosymbiotic events that resulted in the green and red plastid lineages. Smaller differences in trace element stoichiometry within the red and green plastid lineages are consistent with changes in trace elemental stoichiometry owing to the processes associated with secondary endosymbioses and inheritance by descent with modification.},

abstract = {Platinum metals are depleted in the earth's crust relative to their cosmic abundance; concentrations of these elements in deep-sea sediments may thus indicate influxes of extraterrestrial material. Deep-sea limestones exposed in Italy, Denmark, and New Zealand show iridium increases of about 30, 160, and 20 times, respectively, above the background level at precisely the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions, 65 million years ago. Reasons are given to indicate that this iridium is of extraterrestrial origin, but did not come from a nearby supernova. A hypothesis is suggested which accounts for the extinctions and the iridium observations. Impact of a large earth-crossing asteroid would inject about 60 times the object's mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock; a fraction of this dust would stay in the stratosphere for several years and be distributed worldwide. The resulting darkness would suppress photosynthesis, and the expected biological consequences match quite closely the extinctions observed in the paleontological record. One prediction of this hypothesis has been verified: the chemical composition of the boundary clay, which is thought to come from the stratospheric dust, is markedly different from that of clay mixed with the Cretaceous and Tertiary limestones, which are chemically similar to each other. Four different independent estimates of the diameter of the asteroid give values that lie in the range 10 +/- 4 kilometers.},

The results from theMoravo-Silesian Zone (MSZ) of the Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic, demonstrate an excellent relationship existing between the digital intensities of the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colours and CAI in the range from CAI 3 to CAI 6. The R/B colour ratio proved the best proxy of CAI. The R/B ratio decreases with increasing CAI from values {\textgreater}1.6 (CAI3) to {\~{}}1.0 (CAI5) and then slightly increases to 1.15 (mean for CAI5.5) and 1.26 (mean for CAI6). It is closely related to CAI (R2 = 0.8974) within CAI 3 to CAI 5 interval. The R/B ratio is similar in concept to the slope of the reflectance curve obtained from the spectral reflectance of conodonts by previous authors, as well as to the shift from yellow and brown colours towards greyscale conodont colours with increasing thermal maturation according to the original definition of CAI. Regional distribution of the CAI and R/B ratio from the MSZ suggests that the digital conodont colour data is closely related to vitrinite reflectance and illite crystallinity data.},

abstract = {In this study, we report on biomarker abundances through parts of the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB) of Schuchert Dal (East Greenland) that contains rich marine faunal records and excellent terrestrial palynological records. Biomarker abundances and sulfur isotopes are used to correlate the series of events (including changes in element cycling and associated redox conditions of the ocean) surrounding the collapse of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems through this record of a major crisis of life on Earth during a mass extinction episode. The Upper Schuchert Dal Formation contains a low diversity palynological assemblage, ascribed to arborescent cordiaite-conifer-pteridosperm vegetation. Samples from this pre-collapse interval are characterised by high abundances of dibenzofuran (DBF), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and biphenyl. Since these compounds have similar base structures, and show comparable abundance curves, it is plausible that they probably derive from a common source. We propose that phenolic compounds of lignin of the woody plants present during this period could be the source for DBF, DBT and biphenyl. The redox conditions during this period of time also support the formation of DBF and DBT. Just above the extinction interval, there is a dramatic decrease in the abundances of DBF and DBT which occurs at the same time as a sudden change in the stable sulfur isotopic composition ($\delta$34S) of pyrite, indicating a change in redox conditions from oxic to anoxic/euxinic conditions. $\delta$34S values leading up to the extinction are highly depleted in the heavy sulfur isotope (about - 40‰ vs. VCDT), whilst shortly after the extinction interval much more positive isotope values are observed (about - 25‰). An inferred change in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle is supported by facies evidence from similar neighbouring sections. It is suggested that two processes are operating closely here; 1) Changes in redox conditions and 2) extinction and/or transgression accounting for the absence of woody material. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {In order to reveal environmental changes across the Permo-Triassic boundary (PTB), the detailed lithostratigraphy of the PTB interval is analyzed at Chaotian in northern Sichuan, China. The studied section is composed of the Changhsingian (Upper Permian) Dalong Formation and the Induan (Lower Triassic) Feixianguan Formation of a lower-slope facies deposited on the northwestern margin of the Yangtze carbonate platform. The 12-m-thick interval across the PTB consists mainly of bedded carbonates and mudstone, and is lithologically divided into 7 units, i.e., Units A to G, in ascending order. The main extinction horizon of Permian taxa is recognized at the Unit D/E boundary where various fossil metazoans and protists, such as ammonoids, brachiopods, bivalves, conodonts, and radiolarians, rapidly disappeared or became scarce. The complete disappearance of radiolarians at the Unit D/E boundary emphasizes that the PTB extinction affected not only various Late Permian benthic and free-swimming metazoans but also planktonic protozoans. The lowest Induan index conodont Hindeodus parvus first occurs at the base of Unit F, marking the biostratigraphically defined PTB horizon. Unit E composed of unique bedded marl between the main extinction horizon and the first occurrence of Triassic taxon represents a period of strong environmental stresses that suppressed productivity both of silica- and carbonate-secreting organisms. By changing their size, radiolarians reacted most sensitively to the environmental change that already started in the late Changhsingian, appreciably before the final extinction event. The frequent intercalation of rhyo-dacitic tuff beds, particularly in Unit D and the lower part of Unit E across the main extinction horizon, suggests that intermittent felsic volcanism and relevant environmental change may have been responsible for the mass extinction of the Permian taxa and for the prolonged post-extinction lag time before the initial recovery. The frequent ash falls during the late Changhsingian indicate that the volcanism-induced environmental change had already started earlier than the main extinction. All the biological production (carbonate, silica, and organic matter) collapsed at the Unit D/E boundary when the environmental stresses may have passed a critical threshold for maintaining ecological stability. The PTB interval between the extinction and the first appearance of Triassic taxon at Chaotian is ca. 1.4 m thick, apparently almost eight times thicker than that at the Global Stratotype Section and Point of PTB in Meishan (19 cm). The Chaotian section, as well as the neighboring Shangsi section in northern Sichuan, may provide a better chance for high-resolution chemostratigraphic analyses that may allow detection and correlation of subtle environmental changes across the PTB.},

@article{Sarmento2010,
abstract = {Previsions of a warmer ocean as a consequence of climatic change point to a 2-6 degrees C temperature rise during this century in surface oceanic waters. Heterotrophic bacteria occupy the central position of the marine microbial food web, and their metabolic activity and interactions with other compartments within the web are regulated by temperature. In particular, key ecosystem processes like bacterial production (BP), respiration (BR), growth efficiency and bacterial-grazer trophic interactions are likely to change in a warmer ocean. Different approaches can be used to predict these changes. Here we combine evidence of the effects of temperature on these processes and interactions coming from laboratory experiments, space-for-time substitutions, long-term data from microbial observatories and theoretical predictions. Some of the evidence we gathered shows opposite trends to warming depending on the spatio-temporal scale of observation, and the complexity of the system under study. In particular, we show that warming (i) increases BR, (ii) increases bacterial losses to their grazers, and thus bacterial-grazer biomass flux within the microbial food web, (iii) increases BP if enough resources are available (as labile organic matter derived from phytoplankton excretion or lysis), and (iv) increases bacterial losses to grazing at lower rates than BP, and hence decreasing the proportion of production removed by grazers. As a consequence, bacterial abundance would also increase and reinforce the already dominant role of microbes in the carbon cycle of a warmer ocean.},

Surprisingly little is known about the effects and timing of the terrestrial counterpart of the well-described End-Permian mass extinction from known marine successions worldwide. In the present study, reliable paleomagnetic results were obtained from a PT boundary section in the terrestrial Karoo Basin of South Africa. Permo-Triassic aged mudstones from a locality in the Eastern Cape Province yielded two magnetic chrons, reverse followed by normal (with the boundary possibly close to the reversal). This extends to results from a previous study: thereby jointly identifying a R/N/R polarity pattern for this boundary interval. The PTB interval is constrained below the red mudstones of the Beaufort Group at the present locality and within reverse-magnetised green mudstone, implying a diachronic relation between the marine and terrestrial End-Permian mass extinction events.},

Some studies have, however, suggested that Earth's temperature (estimated from the isotopic composition of fossil shells) may have been independent of variations in atmospheric CO2 (e.g. in the Jurassic and Cretaceous). If large changes in atmospheric CO2 did not produce the expected climate responses in the past, predictions of future climate and the case for reducing current fossil-fuel emissions are potentially undermined. Here we evaluate the dataset upon which the Jurassic and Cretaceous assertions are based and present new temperature data, derived from the isotopic composition of fossil brachiopods. Our results are consistent with a warm climate mode for the Jurassic and Cretaceous and hence support the view that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are linked with changes in global temperatures.},

abstract = {Many aspects of the carbon cycle can be assessed from temporal changes in the (13)C/(12)C ratio of oceanic bicarbonate. (13)C/(12)C can temporarily rise when large amounts of (13)C-depleted photosynthetic organic matter are buried at enhanced rates, and can decrease if phytomass is rapidly oxidized or if low (13)C is rapidly released from methane clathrates. Assuming that variations of the marine (13)C/(12)C ratio are directly recorded in carbonate rocks, thousands of carbon isotope analyses of late Precambrian examples have been published to correlate these otherwise undatable strata and to document perturbations to the carbon cycle just before the great expansion of metazoan life. Low (13)C/(12)C in some Neoproterozoic carbonates is considered evidence of carbon cycle perturbations unique to the Precambrian. These include complete oxidation of all organic matter in the ocean and complete productivity collapse such that low-(13)C/(12)C hydrothermal CO(2) becomes the main input of carbon. Here we compile all published oxygen and carbon isotope data for Neoproterozoic marine carbonates, and consider them in terms of processes known to alter the isotopic composition during transformation of the initial precipitate into limestone/dolostone. We show that the combined oxygen and carbon isotope systematics are identical to those of well-understood Phanerozoic examples that lithified in coastal pore fluids, receiving a large groundwater influx of photosynthetic carbon from terrestrial phytomass. Rather than being perturbations to the carbon cycle, widely reported decreases in (13)C/(12)C in Neoproterozoic carbonates are more easily interpreted in the same way as is done for Phanerozoic examples. This influx of terrestrial carbon is not apparent in carbonates older than approximately 850 Myr, so we infer an explosion of photosynthesizing communities on late Precambrian land surfaces. As a result, biotically enhanced weathering generated carbon-bearing soils on a large scale and their detrital sedimentation sequestered carbon. This facilitated a rise in O(2) necessary for the expansion of multicellular life.},

                        2S interface. In November 2007, AVS was low throughout the water column, with the highest concentration at the depth where sulfide was first detected (260m) and with a second peak at 500m. Greigite, pyrite, and particulate elemental sulfur showed distinct concentration maxima near the interface. In May 2008, AVS was not detected in the water column. Maxima for greigite, pyrite, and particulate elemental sulfur were again observed near the interface. We also studied the iron sulfide flux using sediment trap materials collected at the Cariaco station. Pyrite comprised 0.2-0.4{\%} of the total particulate flux in the anoxic water column, with a flux of 0.5-1.6mgSm

                        2S interface. We conclude that pyrite is formed mainly within the redoxcline where sulfur cycling imparts a distinct isotopic signature compared to dissolved sulfide in the deep anoxic water. This conclusion is consistent with our previous study of sulfur species and chemoautotrophic production, which suggests that reaction of sulfide with reactive iron is an important pathway for sulfide oxidation and sulfur intermediate formation near the interface. Pyrite and elemental sulfur distributions favor a pathway of pyrite formation via the reaction of FeS with polysulfides or particulate elemental sulfur near the interface. A comparison of thermodynamic predictions with actual concentration profiles for iron sulfides leads us to argue that microbes may mediate this precipitation. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {A unique and essential feature of germ cells is their immortality. In Caenorhabditis elegans, germline immortality requires the maternal contribution from four genes, mes-2, mes-3, mes-4 and mes-6. We report here that mes-2 encodes a protein similar to the Drosophila Polycomb group protein, Enhancer of zeste, and in the accompanying paper that mes-6 encodes another Polycomb group protein. The Polycomb group is responsible for maintaining proper patterns of expression of the homeotic and other genes in Drosophila. It is thought that Polycomb group proteins form heteromeric complexes and control gene expression by altering chromatin conformation of target genes. As predicted from its similarity to a Polycomb group protein, MES-2 localizes to nuclei. MES-2 is found in germline nuclei in larval and adult worms and in all nuclei in early embryos. By the end of embryogenesis, MES-2 is detected primarily in the two primordial germ cells. The correct distribution of MES-2 requires the wild-type functions of mes-3 and mes-6. We hypothesize that mes-2 encodes a maternal regulator of gene expression in the early germline; its function is essential for normal early development and viability of germ cells.},

abstract = {Pelagic Cretaceous sediments, deposited in a range of palaeotectonic and palaeogeographic settings, from continents to oceans, are commonly black and bituminous. 3 particular time-envelopes define the major occurrences of such facies: late Barremian- Aptian-Albian, the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary and, to a lesser extent, the Coniacian- Santonian. These intervals define the duration of so-called Oceanic Anoxic Events during which global marine waters were relatively depleted in oxygen, and deposition of organic matter, derived from both terrestrial and planktonic sources, was widespread. Cretaceous OAEs correlate closely with transgressions, and such a correlation exists throughout the stratigraphical column. Flooding of land-masses is thought to have transported much terrestrial plant material sea- wards; the progressive increase in shelf-sea area is thought to have stimulated production of marine plankton. Bacterial consumption of this organic matter favoured the development of poorly oxygenated mid- to late Cretaceous waters in which many of the characteristic facies of the Period, including glauconitic sandstones and phosphatic chalks, were deposited},

abstract = {The pattern and causes of Permo/Triassic biotic crisis were mainly documented by faunal and terrestrial plant records. We reviewed herein the geomicrobiological perspective on this issue based on the reported cyanobacterial record. Two episodic cyanobacterial blooms were observed to couple with carbon isotope excursions and faunal mass extinction at Meishan section, suggestive of the presence of at least two episodic biotic crises across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). The two episodes of cyanobacterial blooms, carbon isotope excursions and faunal mass extinction were, respectively, identified in several sections of the world, inferring the presence of two global changes across the PTB. Close associations among the three records (cyanobacterial bloom, shift in carbon isotope composition, and faunal extinction) were subsequently observed in three intervals in the Early Triassic, the protracted recovery period as previously thought, inferring the occurrence of more episodes of global changes. Spatiotemporal association of cyanobacterial blooms with volcanic materials in South China, and probably in South-east Asia, infers their causal relationship. Volcanism is believed to trigger the biotic crisis in several ways and to cause the close association among microbial blooms, the carbon isotope excursions and faunal mass extinctions in four intervals from the latest Permian to the Early Triassic. The major episodes of the well-known Siberian flood eruption are proposed to be responsible for the extinctions in the Early Triassic, but their synchronicity with the end-Permian extinction awaits more precise dating data to confirm. Geomicrobial records are thus suggestive of a long-term episodic biotic crisis (at least four episodes) lasting from the latest Permian to the end of the Early Triassic, induced by the global volcanic eruptions and sea level changes during Pangea formation.},

abstract = {Oxygenic photosynthesis is widely accepted as the most important bioenergetic process happening in Earth's surface environment. It is thought to have evolved within the cyanobacterial lineage, but it has been difficult to determine when it began. Evidence based on the occurrence and appearance of stromatolites and microfossils indicates that phototrophy occurred as long ago as 3,465 Myr although no definite physiological inferences can be made from these objects. Carbon isotopes and other geological phenomena provide clues but are also equivocal. Biomarkers are potentially useful because the three domains of extant life-Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya-have signature membrane lipids with recalcitrant carbon skeletons. These lipids turn into hydrocarbons in sediments and can be found wherever the record is sufficiently well preserved. Here we show that 2-methyl-bacteriohopanepolyols occur in a high proportion of cultured cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial mats. Their 2-methylhopane hydrocarbon derivatives are abundant in organic-rich sediments as old as 2,500 Myr. These biomarkers may help constrain the age of the oldest cyanobacteria and the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis. They could also be used to quantify the ecological importance of cyanobacteria through geological time.},

abstract = {The Gujo-Hachiman section in central Japan provides a rare window into environmental conditions within the Panthalassic Ocean, which encompassed more than half the Earth's surface at 251 Ma. The section is characterized by a sharp transition from green-gray organic-poor cherts to black siliceous shales in the uppermost Permian. Normalization to the clay fraction demonstrates that apparent increases in the concentrations of organic matter and trace metals above this transition were due primarily to the loss of a diluent biogenic (radiolarian) silica flux and only secondarily to a small shift toward more reducing bottom waters. In the black shale, pyrite abundance increases by a factor of ca 30x and is dominated by framboidal grains of probable syngenetic origin. These observations suggest that the expansion of low-oxygen conditions within the Panthalassic Ocean was focused within the oxygen-minimum zone rather than at the seafloor. Such a pattern implies that (1) changes in nutrient fluxes and primary productivity rates, rather than stagnation of oceanic circulation, were a key factor influencing oceanic redox conditions around the Permian-Triassic boundary, and (2) large regions of the Panthalassic Ocean underwent only limited redox changes, providing potential refugia for marine taxa that survived into the Triassic.},

abstract = {The Corg:P ratios of organic-rich facies (TOC {\textgreater} 1{\%}) exhibit considerable variation through the Phanerozoic, from {\textless} 10:1 in the Permian Phosphoria Formation to {\textgreater} 1000:1 in some Devonian black shales. Relative to the composition of phytoplankton (C:P {\~{}} 106:1), which provide the bulk of organic C and P to organic-rich marine sediments, the range of Phanerozoic sedimentary Corg:P ratios largely reflects the influence of benthic redox conditions on diagenetic pathways of C and P remobilization. Enhanced preservation of organic C at lower redox potentials combined with enhanced sedimentary retention of remineralized organic P at higher redox potentials results in a strong relationship between benthic redox conditions and sedimentary Corg:P ratios. The strong secular coherence of the Phanerozoic Corg:P record (i.e., limited variation within narrow time slices) suggests that these ratios are controlled primarily by factors influencing benthic redox conditions on a global scale, such as atmospheric pO2. Inversion and scaling of the Phanerozoic Corg:P record yields a new atmospheric pO2 model that has strong similarities to existing models based on elemental and isotopic mass balances, yet differs in some potentially significant respects. In particular, the new model suggests that atmospheric pO2 was markedly lower during the Early to Middle Paleozoic than previously inferred. During most of the Devonian, atmospheric O2 levels may have been sufficiently low ({\textless} 13{\%}) as to prevent the sustained combustion of plant material. This feature of the model may account for an anomalous gap in the fossil charcoal record during the Devonian. The redox-dependent burial of P in the ocean results in positive and negative feedback mechanisms that tend to stabilize atmospheric oxygen concentrations on geologic timescales. Temporal variations in the burial of P relative to C suggest that the strength of these feedback mechanisms varied over the Phanerozoic.},

abstract = {The Dongpan section in southern Guangxi Province records the influence of local volcanic activity on marine sedimentation at intermediate water depths ({\~{}}200-500 m) in the Nanpanjiang Basin (South China) during the late Permian crisis. We analyzed {\~{}}100 samples over a 12-m-thick interval, generating palynological, paleobiological, and geochemical datasets to investigate the nature and causes of environmental changes. The section records at least two major volcanic episodes that culminated in deposition of approximately 25- to 35-cm-thick ash layers (bentonites) and that had profound effects on conditions in both the Dongpan marine environment and adjacent land areas. Intensification of eruptive activity during each volcanic cycle resulted in a shift toward conifer forests, increased wildfire intensity, and elevated subaerial weathering fluxes. The resulting increase in nutrient fluxes stimulated marine productivity in the short term but led to a negative feedback on productivity in the longer term as the OMZ of the Nanpanjiang Basin expanded, putting both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities under severe stress. Radiolarians exhibit large declines in diversity and abundance well before the global mass extinction horizon, demonstrating the diachroneity of the marine biotic crisis. The latest Permian crisis, which was probably triggered by the Siberian Traps flood basalts, intensified the destructive effects of the earlier local eruptions on terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the South China craton.},

abstract = {An asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous caused mass extinction, but extinction mechanisms are not well-understood. The collapse of sea surface to sea floor carbon isotope gradients has been interpreted as reflecting a global collapse of primary productivity (Strangelove Ocean) or export productivity (Living Ocean), which caused mass extinction higher in the marine food chain. Phytoplankton-dependent benthic foraminifera on the deep-sea floor, however, did not suffer significant extinction, suggesting that export productivity persisted at a level sufficient to support their populations. We compare benthic foraminiferal records with benthic and bulk stable carbon isotope records from the Pacific, Southeast Atlantic, and Southern Oceans. We conclude that end-Cretaceous decrease in export productivity was moderate, regional, and insufficient to explain marine mass extinction. A transient episode of surface ocean acidification may have been the main cause of extinction of calcifying plankton and ammonites, and recovery of productivity may have been as fast in the oceans as on land.},

abstract = {Climate sensitivity in its most basic form is defined as the equilibrium change in global surface temperature that occurs in response to a climate forcing, or externally imposed perturbation of the planetary energy balance.Within this general definition, several specific forms of climate sensitivity exist that differ in terms of the types of climate feedbacks they include. Based on evidence from Earth's history, we suggest here that the relevant form of climate sensitivity in the Anthropocene (e.g. from which to base future greenhouse gas (GHG) stabilization targets) is the Earth system sensitivity including fast feedbacks from changes in water vapour, natural aerosols, clouds and sea ice, slower surface albedo feedbacks from changes in continental ice sheets and vegetation, and climate–GHG feedbacks from changes in natural (land and ocean) carbon sinks. Traditionally, only fast feedbacks have been considered (with the other feedbacks either ignored or treated as forcing), which has led to estimates of the climate sensitivity for doubled CO2 concentrations of about 3◦C. The 2×CO2 Earth system sensitivity is higher than this, being ∼4–6◦C if the ice sheet/vegetation albedo feedback is included in addition to the fast feedbacks, and higher still if climate–GHG feedbacks are also included. The inclusion of climate–GHG feedbacks due to changes in the natural carbon sinks has the advantage of more directly linking anthropogenic GHG emissions with the ensuing global temperature increase, thus providing a truer indication of the climate sensitivity to human perturbations. The Earth system climate sensitivity is difficult to quantify due to the lack of palaeo-analogues for the present-day anthropogenic forcing, and the fact that ice sheet and climate–GHG feedbacks have yet to become globally significant in the Anthropocene. Furthermore, current models are unable to adequately simulate the physics of ice sheet decay and certain aspects of the natural carbon and nitrogen cycles. Obtaining quantitative estimates of the Earth system sensitivity is therefore a high priority for future work},

@article{Melim2002,
abstract = {Carbonate diagenetic models have been heavily influenced by numerous studies of exposed Quaternary limestones. As a result, meteoric diagenesis is often assumed to be the principle means of altering aragonite-rich sediments into calcitic limestones. However, these models are limited by the scarcity of examples of aragonite-rich sediments buried in seawater that have never been influenced by meteoric fluids. The Bahamas transect cores recovered originally aragonite-rich sediments deposited in deep water beyond the easy reach of meteoric waters and provide an opportunity to test current diagenetic paradigms. The Bahamas transect consists of seven cores drilled in the prograding western margin of Great Bahama Bank. The two proximal cores (Clino and Unda) were drilled on the platform top and recovered shallow-water platform to reef facies overlying deeper margin and proximal slope facies. The five distal cores were drilled by ODP Leg 166 in up to 660 m of water and recovered carbonate slope facies. All studied sections are Neogene to Pleistocene in age. Diagenetic environments were identified based on petrographic and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, XRD mineralogy, carbon and oxygen stable isotopic data, and trace elements. The upper 100-150 m of the two proximal cores were altered in meteoric to mixing-zone diagenetic environments but all other intervals were altered exclusively in marine pore fluids during seafloor, marine-burial, and deep-burial diagenesis. Several of the findings of this study question current carbonate diagenetic paradigms. These include: (1) large-scale sea level lowstands may not have chemically active meteoric lenses as we found no meteoric alteration at the -120 m elevation of the latest Pleistocene lowstand. Rather, phreatic meteoric diagenesis appears restricted to within approximate to10 m of the land surface. (2) Mixing-zone diagenesis includes aragonite dissolution and minor LMC cementation but does not show the cavernous porosity or dolomitization predicted by mixing-zone diagenetic models. Current models are based on coastal mixing zones, which do not appear to be applicable to these more inland, and perhaps more typical, locations. (3) Marine-burial diagenesis produces a mature limestone with fabrics formerly considered diagnostic for meteoric diagenesis such as moldic porosity, aragonite neomorphism, blocky calcite spar and calcite microspar. However, oxygen stable isotopic data (average delta(18)O = +1parts per thousand) indicate alteration in marine pore fluids only. The character of marine-burial diagenesis is partially controlled by the nature of the sediment being altered. We have identified two end-member styles, an open-system style characterized by dissolution of aragonite without significant cementation and a more closed-system style with aragonite dissolution accompanied by calcite cementation. The sediments examined were deposited well above the aragonite compensation depth, so seawater entering the sediment is saturated with respect to aragonite. The under-saturation needed to drive diagenesis is likely the result of bacterial oxidation of organic matter using sulfate. (4) Microspar forms in these sediments as a cement based on petrographic and SEM examination of partly to completely altered samples. This contradicts the common assumption that microspar forms by aggrading neomorphism of micrite. (5) Strontium content of sediments altered in marine pore fluids can show an extreme range of values, formerly thought to indicate different environments. The opportunity to finally examine the diagenesis of aragonite-rich sediments buried in seawater challenges current diagenetic paradigms and emphasizes the importance of integrated studies.

abstract = {One of the most important carbon cycle perturbations following the end-Permian mass extinction event straddles the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB) (Olenekian, Early Triassic). This anomaly is characterized by a prominent positive carbon isotope excursion known from Tethyan marine rocks. Its global significance is established here by a new high paleolatitude record (Spitsbergen). Paleontological evidence, such as Boreal palynological data (Barents Sea, Norway) and global patterns of ammonoid distribution, indicates a synchronous major change in terrestrial and marine ecosystems near the SSB. The reestablishment of highly diverse plant ecosystems, including the rise of woody gymnosperms and decline of the formerly dominating lycopods, is interpreted as an effect of a major climate change. This hypothesis is supported by modeling of ammonoid paleobiogeography, the distribution patterns of which are interpreted as a proxy for sea surface temperatures (SST). The latest Smithian thus appears to have been a time of a warm and equable climate as expressed by an almost flat pole to equator SST gradient. In contrast, the steep Spathian SST gradient suggests latitudinally differentiated climatic conditions. We propose that this drastic climate change and the global carbon cycle perturbation were triggered by a massive end-Smithian CO2 injection. The SSB event could therefore represent one of the causes for stepwise and delayed recovery of marine and terrestrial biotas in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis.},

abstract = {Climate change over the past approximately 30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species and has been implicated in one species-level extinction. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range ( approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change ( approximately 35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

The co- occurrence of the megaspore Otynisporites eotriassicus Fuglewicz 1977, and its restricted distribution elsewhere in marine sections with either Late Permian ammonoids or the basal Triassic conodont marker Hindeodus parvus, confirms the age range, and correlation of the Russian and NW Chinese sections. In three Chinese sections, rapid changes in carbon isotopic (13Corg) composition of between 4 and 10‰ occur over the intervals showing abnormal pollen. These patterns reflect bioclastic facies contributions responding to local environmental changes. They are nevertheless coincident with global perturbations in the atmosphere, caused by extensive volcanic activity around the Permian–Triassic boundary.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Carbonate minerals such as dolomite, kutnahorite or rhodochrosite are frequently, but not exclusively generated by microbial processes. In recent anoxic sediments, Mn(II)carbonate minerals (e.g. rhodochrosite, kutnahorite) derive mainly from the reduction of Mn(IV) compounds by anaerobic respiration. The formation of huge manganese-rich (carbonate) deposits requires effective manganese redox cycling in an oxygenated atmosphere. However, putative anaerobic pathways such as microbial nitrate-dependent manganese oxidation, anoxygenic photosynthesis and oxidation in ultraviolet light may facilitate manganese cycling even in an early Archean environment, without the availability of oxygen. In addition, manganese carbonates precipitate by microbially induced processes without change of the oxidation state, e.g. by pH shift. Hence, there are several ways how these minerals could have been formed biogenically and deposited in Precambrian sediments. We will summarize microbially induced manganese carbonate deposition in the presence and absence of atmospheric oxygen and we will make some considerations about the biogenic deposition of manganese carbonates in early Archean settings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {After the worldwide drastic Permo-Triassic event, a thick sequence of shallow-water carbonates, i.e., the Sefid Kuh Formation, was formed before the late Early Triassic. For the first time dasycladacean algae (Acicularia sp.) were found there, together with foraminifera which are typical of the Lower Triassic. A carbonate ramp is formed by several parasequences, each of them shallowing upwards and consisting of grainstones and packstones, being oolithic and/or pelletoidal, mudstones being strongly affected by bioturbation ("Wurstelkalk", "vermicular limestone"), crinoids ("Holocrinus" sp.), packstone tempestites, and algal boundstones. The Sefid Kuh limestone formation as a whole is the product of a transgression-regression cycle. According to conodont stratigraphical studies, this cycle set in at Spathian times and came to an end in ?Aegean/Bithynian times. This T-R cycle is probably of eustatic nature, as comparisons with coeval sequences of the western Tethys realm show. Geodynamic considerations of R. Brandner result in the conclusion that in the area studied the northern Paleozoic Tethys ocean was entirely subducted already in Permo-Triassic times.},

Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales, the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers, we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses, and lack of strong continental interconnectivity, probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale, without an expectation of marked tipping patterns. This implies that identifying critical points along global continua of drivers might be unfeasible and that characterizing global biotic change with single aggregates is inapt.},

abstract = {The biochronological characterization of the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) is here improved by means of conodont unitary associations zones (UAZs). The selected data set comprises the six best documented sections in South China, including the Meishan global stratotype section and point of the PTB. This new biochronological zonation has a much higher accuracy than previous schemes, which were based on continuous interval zones. We show how traditional interval zones around the PTB in South China suffer from diachronous boundaries that cross each other as the result of sampling effort (intensity and density) and of geographical or ecological exclusion of zonal index taxa, inclusive of the first occurrence of the base Triassic index species Hindeodus parvus. Our quantitative and robust approach produces a discrete sequence comprising six UAZs. In the closest agreement with the position of the PTB in Meishan, the PTB falls here in the interval of separation between UAZ2 and UAZ3. In Meishan, this interval of separation corresponds to the stratigraphic interval above bed 25 and below bed 27, which also includes the formational boundary between the Changhsing and the Yinkeng formations. We provide a new and independent support for this placement by showing that it correlates with the main turnover of conodont species within the analysed time interval. As previously documented, the main extinction interval ranged from bed 25 to bed 28 in Meishan, which are here assigned to UAZ2 and to UAZ4, respectively. Therefore, the main extinction episode is not of end-Permian age but straddles the PTB. Previous claims for two distinct extinction pulses bracketing the PTB in South China were based on traditional conodont interval zones and are not supported by the new UA zonation. The oldest Triassic UAZ3 is identified by the characteristic species Hindeodus pisai and by any of the ten characteristic pairs of species Neogondolella zhejiangensis or Neogondolella tulongensis associated with Hindeodus changxingensis, Hindeodus parvus, Neogondolella planata, Neogondolella taylorae or Isarcicella huckriedei. Separate analyses of anchignathodontids and neogondolellids sub-data sets show that the base of the Triassic is unambiguously defined by the occurrences of the characteristic species H. changxingensis, Isarcicella prisca, and I. huckriedei in shallow-water settings, and of two characteristic species, N. planata and N. taylorae, in deep-water settings. Moreover, we document uncoupled diversity trends across the PTB for each of these two clades. A substantial diversification phase of anchignathodontids spans the interval from UAZ3 to UAZ5. It is followed by a drastic (50{\%}) reduction of the number of species between UAZ5 and UAZ6. On the other hand, neogondolellids show a protracted extinction from UAZ4 to UAZ6. In South China, correlations are proposed for the microbialite-bearing sections and deeper-water PTB sections. The UA method also highlights which parts of the conodont record are still insufficiently documented for reliable correlations. Biochronological correlations with Meishan and its U-Pb radio-isotopic ages allow inferring a maximal duration of 61 ± 48 ka for the gap at the base of the Triassic microbial limestone at Dajiang, a time interval that also corresponds to the duration of the main extinction episode in Meishan.},

@article{Riding2000,
abstract = {Deposits produced by microbial growth and metabolism have been important components of carbonate sediments since the Archaean. Geologically best known in seas and lakes, microbial carbonates are also important at the present day in fluviatile, spring, cave and soil environments. The principal organisms involved are bacteria, particularly cyanobacteria, small algae and fungi, that participate in the growth of microbial biofilms and mats. Grain-trapping is locally important, but the key process is precipitation, producing reefal accumulations of calcified microbes and enhancing mat accretion and preservation. Various metabolic processes, such as photosynthetic uptake of CO2 and/or HCO3- by cyanobacteria, and ammonification, denitrification and sulphate reduction by other bacteria, can increase alkalinity and stimulate carbonate precipitation. Extracellular polymeric substances, widely produced by microbes for attachment and protection, are important in providing nucleation sites and facilitating sediment trapping. Microbial carbonate microfabrics are heterogeneous. They commonly incorporate trapped particles and in situ algae and invertebrates, and crystals form around bacterial cells, but the main component is dense, clotted or peloidal micrite resulting from calcification of bacterial cells, sheaths and biofilm, and from phytoplankton-stimulated whiting nucleation. Interpretation of these texturally convergent and often inscrutable fabrics is a challenge. Conspicuous accumulations are large domes and columns with laminated (stromatolite), clotted (thrombolite) and other macrofabrics, which may be either agglutinated or mainly composed of calcified or spar-encrusted microbes. Stromatolite lamination appears to be primary, but clotted thrombolite fabrics can be primary or secondary. Microbial precipitation also contributes to hot-spring travertine, cold-spring mound, calcrete, cave crust and coated grain deposits, as well as influencing carbonate cementation, recrystallization and replacement. Microbial carbonate is biologically stimulated but also requires favourable saturation state in ambient water, and thus relies uniquely on a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. This overriding environmental control is seen at the present day by the localization of microbial carbonates in calcareous streams and springs and in shallow tropical seas, and in the past by temporal variation in abundance of marine microbial carbonates. Patterns of cyanobacterial calcification and microbial dome formation through time appear to reflect fluctuations in seawater chemistry. Stromatolites appeared at similar to 3450 Ma and were generally diverse and abundant from 2800 to 1000 Ma. Inception of a Proterozoic decline, variously identified at 2000, 1000 and 675 Ma, has been attributed to eukaryote competition and/or reduced lithification. Thrombolites and dendrolites mainly formed by calcified cyanobacteria became important early in the Palaeozoic, and reappeared in the Late Devonian. Microbial carbonates retained importance through much of the Mesozoic, became scarcer in marine environments in the Cenozoic, but locally re-emerged as large agglutinated domes, possibly reflecting increased algal involvement, and thick micritic reef crusts in the late Neogene. Famous modern examples at Shark Bay and Lee Stocking Island are composite coarse agglutinated domes and columns with complex bacterial-algal mats occurring in environments that are both stressed and current-swept: products of mat evolution, ecological refugia, sites of enhanced early lithification or all three?},

abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO(2) (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

abstract = {We studied the isotopic composition of dissolved sulfide in the Black Sea water column during different seasons at a total of 15 stations spanning the entire basin. The isotopic composition of dissolved sulfide averaged over all depths varies between -42.0‰ and -32.6‰, ave. -39.6±1.3‰ (1 $\sigma$ ) (118 data points). Seasonal and spatial (open sea vs. coastal stations) differences in the $\delta$ 34S-H2S values are not observed. Slight 34S enrichments in the sulfide isotope composition are revealed in the uppermost and the lowest parts of the anoxic water column. The upper trend is explained as (i) the effect of mixing with 34S-enriched sulfide produced near the interface by chemical oxidation with MnO2 or O2, (ii) small fractionation during biological sulfide oxidation, (iii) a result of a decreased isotope fractionation factor due to higher sulfate reduction rates. The lower trend is likely the result of the mixing with 34S-enriched pore water sulfide. We generated the first isotope data for sulfur intermediates in the lower part of the anoxic zone, which show values close to the isotope composition of dissolved sulfide. We hypothesize that the high isotope depletions of sulfide observed in the entire Black Sea water column are a result of low sulfate reduction rates and superimposed disproportionation reactions within the oxidative part of the sulfur cycle. Different physical and chemical mechanisms facilitating the formation and transport of sulfur intermediates in the anoxic interior are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {During Permian stage 6 (Wordian, Kazanian) the Pangaean supercontinent was surrounded by a superocean: Panthalassa. An ocean general circulation model has been coupled to an atmospheric energy balance model to simulate the sensitivity of the Wordian climate (鈭?65 million years ago) to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, high-latitude geography, and Earth orbital configurations. The model simulates significantly different circulation features with different levels of greenhouse gas forcing, ranging from a strong meridional overturning circulation in the Southern Hemisphere at low CO2 concentration (present level) to more symmetric overturning circulation cells with deep water formation in polar latitudes of both hemispheres at high CO2 concentration (8 times present level). The simulated climate with 4 times present level CO2 concentration agrees generally well with climate-sensitive sediments and phytogeographic patterns. The model simulates strong subtropical gyres with similarities to the modern South Pacific circulation and moderate surface temperatures on the southern continent Gondwana, resulting from a strong poleward heat transport in the ocean. An even more moderate climate is generated if high-latitude land is removed from the southern continent so that ocean currents can penetrate into the polar regions of Gondwana.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction event coincides with a dramatic negative shift in both the $\delta$13C and the $\delta$18O isotope record, at or near the extinction horizon, from multiple marine and terrestrial sections round the globe. This study has identified the isotope excursions in a shallow water, carbonate-dominated, section at Val Brutta in the Southern Alps. High resolution bulk rock sampling revealed that there is an average $\delta$13Ccarb negative shift of - 4‰ and a $\delta$18Ocarb shift of - 6‰. This is similar to the isotope record at other nearby localities. This section, like many others, shows a degree of recrystallisation which hampers absolute palaeotemperature calculations. However, some brachiopod fossils, including specimens of Comelicania and Janiceps, found within the beds that contain the bulk rock anomaly, appear to be remarkably well preserved and still retain their internal structure and the primary isotopic variation across the shell. As such, they have been successfully analysed and the data used to produce a palaeotemperature estimate, at the time of the isotope anomaly, of between 26 and 29 °C for latest Permian. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Complete, continuous marine Permian–Triassic (P–T) boundary sections in the B{\"{u}}kk Mountains, Northern Hungary, represent a ramp setting on the margin of the western Tethys. The Upper Permian succession comprises limestone rich in calcareous algae, foraminifera, and skeletal fragments of metazoans. A significant reduction of biogenic components occurs in the topmost limestone layers below the “boundary shale bed” (BSB). It coincides with the beginning of a gradual negative shift in $\delta$13Ccarb values that continues into the BSB. The BSB consists predominantly of marly siltstones that are similar to the insoluble residue of the underlying limestone. A second biotic decline is recorded in the upper-third of the BSB, where the continuous negative shift in $\delta$13C values is superimposed by a sharp and quasi-symmetric negative peak. The $\delta$13C peak is confined to the shale bed and is not correlated with the lithological change, therefore diagenetic or other secondary effects are ruled out. The carbon isotope signal reflects primary processes related to significant changes in environmental conditions. Correlation and comparison of sedimentological, biotic, geochemical and mineralogical features of the studied sections in the B{\"{u}}kk Mountains with other Tethyan P—T sections in the Southern Alps, Dinarides, Iran, Kasmir (India) and southern China are discussed. The continuous shift in $\delta$13C values is most probably related to a decrease in bioproductivity, whereas the sharp peak is attributed to an addition of C strongly depleted in 13C isotope to the ocean–atmosphere system. The most plausible model is a massive release of methane from gas–hydrate dissociation. This event led to the extinction of the already impoverished biota. Scarcity of metazoans and prolonged unfavourable environmental conditions gave rise to a bloom of microbial communities. Mineralogical and geochemical analyses failed to reveal any evidence for extraterrestrial effects or synchronous volcanism were found in the studied sections.},

We show that the overall magnitude of the $\delta$18O shift is smaller than previously thought (1-1.5‰ vs 6 ‰).Expanding on previous work, we explore the effects of Quaternary sea level variations on the global sulfur cycle. Our modeling results confirm the earlier hypothesis that the increased duration and amplitude of sea level lowstands during the Quaternary favors direct sulfide oxidation over microbial disproportionation. We show that oxygen isotope ratios of core top barite are up to 2.5‰ lower than the seawater sulfate $\delta$18O value. We hypothesize that this offset is caused by incorporation of sulfate from oxidized organic sulfur compounds during precipitation of barite. Our results provide another puzzle piece in the attempt to understand the origin of marine barite.},

abstract = {Time series of terrigenous source elements (Al, K, Ti, Zr) from core GeoB4901-8 recovered from the deep-sea fan of the Niger River record variations in riverine sediment discharge over the past 245,000 yr. Although the flux rates of all the elements depend on physical erosion, which is mainly controlled by the extent of vegetation coverage in central Africa, element/Al ratios reflect conditions for chemical weathering in the river basin. Maximum sediment input to the ocean occurs during cold and and periods, when precipitation intensity and associated freshwater runoff are reduced. High carbonate contents during the same periods indicate that the sediment supply has a positive effect on river-induced marine productivity In general, variations in the terrestrial signals contain a strong precessional component in tune with changes in low-latitude solar radiation. However, the terrestrial signal lags the insolation signal by several thousand years. K/Al, Ti/Al, and Zr/Al records reveal that African monsoonal precipitation depends on high-latitude forcing. We attribute the shift between insolation cycle and river discharge to the frequently reported nonlinear response of African climate to primary orbital configurations, which may be caused by a complex interaction of the secondary control parameters, such as surface albedo and/or thermohaline circulation.

abstract = {Carbon-isotope stratigraphy is a useful tool for stratigraphic correlation, especially for strata deposited during major perturbations of the carbon cycle that affected the marine, terrestrial and atmospheric reservoirs. For the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, effectively defined by a first-order mass extinction, major fluctuations in carbon-isotope values have been well documented, but these datasets have generally been derived from bulk-rock samples. Hence, the extent to which features of the isotopic curve reflect diagenetic alteration or changing proportions of constituent materials is unconstrained. Here, carbon- and oxygen-isotope data are presented from well-preserved oyster shells (Liostrea) comprising low-magnesium calcite, a mineral species relatively resistant to diagenetic alteration. Samples were obtained from Lavernock Point, Glamorgan, Wales, a coastal section close to a candidate stratotype for the base of the Jurassic at St Audrie's Bay, Somerset, England. The carbon-isotope signature from St Audrie's Bay, previously defined on the basis of analysis of bulk organic matter, is confirmed by our new data. Major features are (1) the upper part of an 'initial' negative isotope excursion in the lowest part of the section, followed by (2) a pronounced positive excursion, and (3) an extended 'main' negative isotope excursion in the highest part of the section. The data confirm that the carbon-isotope stratigraphy previously documented from bulk organic matter in SW England records the chemical composition of the contemporaneous seawater. Bulk carbonates sampled over the same interval near Lyme Regis, England, show similar trends to those from oyster calcite in the lower part of the study section, but there are more 13C-depleted values up-section. These lower values probably result from an admixture of primary and diagenetic carbonate. Palaeotemperatures calculated from oxygen-isotope values from Lavernock Point oyster shells are relatively cool at the beginning of the positive carbon-isotope excursion, and increased by up to 10 {\{}degrees{\}}C during the main negative carbon-isotope excursion. The new results are compatible with the view that positive carbon-isotope excursions correspond to times of low atmospheric carbon dioxide content, whereas negative carbon-isotope excursions correspond to times of high atmospheric carbon dioxide content, as is also found to be the case during the Early Jurassic (Toarcian) Oceanic Anoxic Event. The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios and {\{}delta{\}}18O of investigated Liostrea hisingeri show no correlation, supporting data from modern bivalves that indicate that incorporation of Mg and Sr is controlled mainly by factors other than temperature.},

We obtained detailed distributions of sulfur isotopes of total dissolved sulfide and sulfate as part of the on-going CARIACO time series project to explore the critical pathways at the level of individual sulfur species. Isotopic patterns of sulfate (??34SSO4) and sulfide (??34SH2S) were similar to trends observed in the Black Sea water column: ??34SH2S and ??34SSO4 were constant in the deep anoxic water (varying within 0.6??? for sulfide and 0.3??? for sulfate), with sulfide roughly 54??? depleted in 34S relative to sulfate. Near the oxic-anoxic interface, however, the ??34SH2S value was {\~{}}3??? heavier than that in the deep water, which may reflect sulfide oxidation and/or a change in fractionation during in situ sulfide production through sulfate reduction (SR) ??34SH2S and ??33SH2S data near the oxic-anoxic interface did not provide unequivocal evidence to support the important role of sulfur-intermediate disproportionation suggested by previous studies. Repeated observation of minimum ??34SSO4 values near the interface suggests 'readdition' of 34S-depleted sulfate during sulfide oxidation. A slight increase in ??34SSO4 values with depth extended over the water column may indicate a reservoir effect associated with removal of 34S-depleted sulfur during sulfide production through SR. Our ??34SH2S and ??33SH2S data also do not show a clear role for sulfur-intermediate disproportionation in the deep anoxic water column. We interpret the large difference in ??34S between sulfate and sulfide as reflecting fractionations during SR in the Cariaco deep waters that are larger than those generally observed in culturing studies. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Significant amounts of SO42-, Na+, and OH- are incorporated in marine biogenic calcites. Biogenic high Mg-calcites average about 1 mole percent SO42-. Aragonites and most biogenic low Mg-calcites contain significant amounts of Na+, but very low concentrations of SO42-. The SO42- content of non-biogenic calcites and aragonites investigated was below 100 ppm. The presence of Na+ and SO42- increases the unit cell size of calcites. The solid-solutions show a solubility minimum at about 0.5 mole percent SO42- beyond which the solubility rapidly increases. The solubility product of calcites containing 3 mole percent SO42- is the same as that of aragonite. Na+ appears to have very little effect on the solubility product of calcites. The amounts of Na+ and SO42- incorporated in calcites vary as a function of the rate of crystal growth. The variation of the distribution coefficient (D) of SO42- in calcite at 25.0°C and 0.50 molal NaCl is described by the equation D = k0 + k1R where k0 and k1 are constants equal to 6.16 × 10-6 and 3.941 × 10-6, respectively, and R is the rate of crystal growth of calcite in mg{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}g-1 of seed. The data on Na+ are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant amount of Na+ occupies interstitial positions in the calcite structure. The distribution of Na+ follows a Freundlich isotherm and not the Berthelot-Nernst distribution law. The numerical value of the Na+ distribution coefficient in calcite is probably dependent on the number of defects in the calcite structure. The Na+ contents of calcites are not very accurate indicators of environmental salinities. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Life at the Permian-Triassic boundary (ca. 251 Ma) underwent the largest disruption in Earth's history. Paleoclimatic data indicate that Earth was significantly warmer than present and that much of the ocean was anoxic or euxinic for an extended period of time. We present results from the first fully coupled comprehensive climate model using paleogeography for this time period. The coupled climate system model simulates warm high-latitude surface air temperatures related to elevated carbon dioxide levels and a stagnate global ocean circulation in concert with paleodata indicating low oxygen levels at ocean depth. This is the first climate simulation that captures these observed features of this time period.},

abstract = {The severe mass extinction of marine and terrestrial organisms at the end of the Permian Period (c. 251 Ma) was accompanied by a rapid ({\textless} 100 000 years and possibly {\textless} 10 000 years) negative excursion of c. 3 parts per thousand in the delta(13)C of the global surface oceans and atmosphere that persisted for some 500 000 years into the Early Triassic. Simulations with an ocean-atmosphere/carbon-cycle model suggest that the isotope excursion can be explained by collapse of ocean primary productivity, and changes in the delivery and cycling of carbon in the oceans and on land. Model results suggest that severe reduction of marine productivity led to an increase in surface-ocean dissolved inorganic carbon and a rapid, short-term increase in atmospheric pCO(2) (from a Late Permian base of 850 ppm to c. 2500 ppm). Increase in surface ocean alkalinity may have stimulated the widespread microbial and abiotic shallow-water carbonate deposition seen in the earliest Triassic. The model is also consistent with a long-term ({\textgreater} 1 Ma) decrease in sedimentary burial of organic carbon in the early Triassic.},

abstract = {Early Triassic carbon isotopes are measured based on 1422 carbonate bulk samples from 10 Lower Triassic sections in different palaeogeographic settings in South China. Early Triassic fluctuation of d13C is used as a proxy for environmental change to discuss the devastation and restoration of marine ecosystems following the biggest Phanerozoic mass extinction at the end of the Permian. Early Triassic d13C profiles derived from various depositional settings in South China yield comparable excursion patterns. A dramatic negative shift of d13C across the Permian/Triassic boundary is followed by a moderate increase in d13Cvalues throughout the Induan.Apositive d13Canomaly occurs near the Induan/Olenekian boundary, followed by a Smithian interval of lower d13C values.Adistinct positive shift in d13C coincides with the Smithian/Spathian boundary, and is followed by a high Spathian plateau of d13C values. Thus the distinct d13C anomalies coincide well with key stratigraphic boundaries. Early Triassic intervals of lowd13C values correspond to a decline in benthic generic diversity in South China and intervals of high d13Cvalues are coupled with an increase in biodiversity. The Early Triassic fluctuations of d13Cprofiles are good proxies for perturbations of ecologic environments, indicating multiple phases of devastation–restoration of marine ecosystems punctuated by several unexpected extraneous events such as volcanic activity. The initial restoration of marine ecosystems may have occurred earlier in the Induan and the ecosystems were subsequently destroyed during the Smithian. Biotic and environmental recoveries occurred at the Spathian, while the ecosystems eventually returned to normal levels in the early Middle Triassic.},

abstract = {The calcium isotopic compositions (??44Ca) of 30 high-purity nannofossil ooze and chalk and 7 pore fluid samples from ODP Site 807A (Ontong Java Plateau) are used in conjunction with numerical models to determine the equilibrium calcium isotope fractionation factor (??s-f) between calcite and dissolved Ca2+ and the rates of post-depositional recrystallization in deep sea carbonate ooze. The value of ??s-f at equilibrium in the marine sedimentary section is 1.0000 ?? 0.0001, which is significantly different from the value (0.9987 ?? 0.0002) found in laboratory experiments of calcite precipitation and in the formation of biogenic calcite in the surface ocean. We hypothesize that this fractionation factor is relevant to calcite precipitation in any system at equilibrium and that this equilibrium fractionation factor has implications for the mechanisms responsible for Ca isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. We describe a steady state model that offers a unified framework for explaining Ca isotope fractionation across the observed precipitation rate range of ???14 orders of magnitude. The model attributes Ca isotope fractionation to the relative balance between the attachment and detachment fluxes at the calcite crystal surface. This model represents our hypothesis for the mechanism responsible for isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. The Ca isotope data provide evidence that the bulk rate of calcite recrystallization in freshly-deposited carbonate ooze is 30-40{\%}/Myr, and decreases with age to about 2{\%}/Myr in 2-3 million year old sediment. The recrystallization rates determined from Ca isotopes for Pleistocene sediments are higher than those previously inferred from pore fluid Sr concentration and are consistent with rates derived for Late Pleistocene siliciclastic sediments using uranium isotopes. Combining our results for the equilibrium fractionation factor and recrystallization rates, we evaluate the effect of diagenesis on the Ca isotopic composition of marine carbonates at Site 807A. Since calcite precipitation rates in the sedimentary column are many orders of magnitude slower than laboratory experiments and the pore fluids are only slightly oversaturated with respect to calcite, the isotopic composition of diagenetic calcite is likely to reflect equilibrium precipitation. Accordingly, diagenesis produces a maximum shift in ??44Ca of +0.15??? for Site 807A sediments but will have a larger impact where sedimentation rates are low, seawater circulates through the sediment pile, or there are prolonged depositional hiatuses. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These reefs experienced substantial diel fluctuations in temperature (0.78°C) and pH ({\textgreater}0.2) similar to the magnitude of 'warming' and 'acidification' expected over the next century. Where daily pH within the benthic boundary layer failed to exceed pelagic climatological seasonal lows, net accretion was slower and fleshy, non-calcifying benthic organisms dominated space.

@article{Canfield1999,
abstract = {There are 2 principal avenues of inquiry relevant to reconstruct- ing the history of the sulfur cycle. One avenue relies on the comparison of molecular sequences derived from biologically essential proteins and genetic material. Most sequence information is available from the small subunit of the rRNA molecule and from these sequences a Tree of Life emerges providing a reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships among organisms. Near the root of the tree are numerous bacteria1metabolizing sulfur species including organ- isms living from dissimilatory elemental sulfur reduction, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and anoxygenic photosynthesis. These metabolisms are likely very ancient. Many of the deep-branching bacteria of the sulfur cycle are active at very high temperatures (hyperthermophiles) and are commonly found in modern sulfide-rich hydrothermal systems. One can imagine a primitive early Earth terrestrial ecosystem housed around active hydrothermal areas with anoxygenic photosynthesis producing organic matter and oxidized sulfur species. These oxidized sulfur species could have been used as electron acceptors in the mineral- ization of organic matter, completing the carbon cycle. The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis provided for dramatically increased rates of carbon production, and a much wider range of ecosystems for both carbon production, and carbon oxidation. Either associated with, or following, the evolution of oxygenic photo- synthesis is the emergence of lineages housing most of the bacteria of which we are familiar, including most of the bacteria of the sulfur cycle. The geologic record can provide direct evidence for the state of chemical oxidation of the Earth-surface, with possible indications of when specific bacterial metabolisms first occurred. We offer the following scenario for the evolution of the Earth-surface environment based on the available geological evidence. By 3.5 Ga anoxygenic photosynthesis was established and provided a weak source of sulfate to the global ocean with sulfate concentrations likely 91 mM. In some instances locally high concentrations of sulfate could accumulate and precipi- tated as evaporitic sulfate minerals. There is no compelling evidence for sulfate reduction at this time. The first evidence for sulfate reduction is found between 2.7 and 2.5 Ga, and the first evidence for oxygen production by oxygenic photosynthesis is found at around 2.8 Ga. Even so, levels of seawater sulfate remained low, below 1 mM, and did not increase toG1mMuntil around 2.3 Ga. This increase in sulfate levels may have been promoted by a rise in atmospheric oxygen concentration at this time. Throughout the Archean and early Protero- zoic the deep oceans contained appreciable concentrations of dissolved ferrous iron, and banded iron formations (BIFs) were a common form of chemical sediment. Sulfate levels increased slowly, and by 1.8 Ga sulfate concentrations were sufficient to increase rates of sulfate reduction to greater than the delivery flux of iron to the oceans. Sulfide accumulated and precipitated ferrous iron from solution. It is proposed that the oceans remained sulfide-rich until the Neoprotero- zoic, where renewed deposition of banded iron formations occurred at around 0.75 Ga. It is possible that during the Neoproterozoic, decreased carbon produc- tion resulted from an ice covered ‘‘Snowball Earth'' reducing rates of sulfate reduction below rates of iron delivery to the oceans, promoting BIF formation. At around this time high carbon burial rates increased levels of atmospheric oxygen toG10 percent present-day levels, promoting the widespread oxidation of marine surface sediments and an evolutionary radiation of sulfide oxidizing bacteria. *},

abstract = {Changes in redox conditions during the Changhsingian to Griesbachian spanning the end-Permian mass extinction were recently reported based on analyses of organic molecules. We provide more precise organic-molecular data, that detail redox conditions spanning the end-Permian mass extinction at different palaeowater depths in the neritic Palaeotethys (estimated water depths: 10, 40, 100, and 200 m; Bulla, Huangzhishan, Meishan, and Chaohu sections, respectively) during this period. Here we propose that a change from occasional euxinia to anoxia in the shallow Palaeotethys occurred at the time of the mass extinction intercalated with oxic pulses. The second extinction at 0.7 myr after the main extinction was also caused by anoxia. New and published sulfur-isotope ratios (34S/32S) measured in carbonate-associated sulfate from the neritic Palaeotethys and in sulfide from pelagic central Panthalassa sediments show high values during the Changhsingian, consistent with the development of euxinia. The mass extinction coincided with a global fall in $\delta$34S values, as well as a shift in $\delta$13C values, indicating a global oxidation of H2S. This organic and isotopic geochemistry implies that accumulation of hydrogen sulfide in intermediate and deep waters followed by oxidation of hydrogen sulfide led to dissolved oxygen consumption, surface-water anoxia, and acidification, resulting in the end-Permian mass extinction in the seas.},

abstract = {Chemical reactions in marine sediments and the resulting fluxes across the sediment-water interface influence the global carbon cycle and the pH of the sea and affect the abundance of CaCO3 and opal-forming plankton in the ocean. On very long timescales these diagenetic reactions control carbon burial in sedimentary rocks and the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Sedimentary deposits that remain after diagenesis are the geochemical artifacts used for interpreting past changes in ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycles, and climate. This chapter is about the processes of diagenesis and burial of the chemical elements that make up the bulk of the particulate matter that reaches the seafloor (organic matter, CaCO3, SiO2, Fe, Mn, and aluminosilicates).Understanding of sediment diagenesis and benthic fluxes has evolved with advances in both experimental methods and modeling. Measurements of chemical concentrations in sediments, their associated pore waters and fluxes at the sediment-water interface have been used to identify the most important reactions. Because transport in pore waters is usually by molecular diffusion, this medium is conducive to interpretation by models of heterogeneous chemical equilibrium and kinetics. Large chemical changes and manageable transport mechanisms have led to elegant models of sediment diagenesis and great advances in understanding of diagenetic processes.We shall see, though, that the environment does not yield totally to simple models of chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics, and laboratory determined constants often cannot explain the field observations. For example, organic matter degradation rate constants determined from modeling are so variable that there are essentially no constraints on these values from laboratory experiments. In addition, reaction rates of CaCO3 and opal dissolution determined from modeling pore waters usually cannot be reproduced in laboratory experiments of these reactions. The inability to mechanistically understand reaction kinetics calculated from diagenesis models is an important uncertainty in the field today.Processes believed to be most important in controlling the preservation of organic matter have evolved from a focus on the lability of the substrate to the protective mechanisms of mineral-organic matter interactions. The specific electron acceptor is not particularly important during very early diagenesis, but the importance of oxygen to the degradation of organic matter during later stages of diagenesis has been clarified by the study of diagenesis in turbidites deposited on the ocean floor during glacial periods.Evolution of thinking about the importance of reactions between seawater and detrital clay minerals has come full circle since the mid-1960s. "Reverse weathering" reactions were hypothesized in very early chemical equilibrium (Sillen, 1961) and mass-balance ( Mackenzie and Garrels, 1966) models of the oceans. Subsequent observations that marine clay minerals generally resemble those weathered from adjacent land and the discovery of hydrothermal circulation put these ideas on the back burner. Recent studies of silicate and aluminum diagenesis, however, have rekindled awareness of this process, and it is back in the minds of geochemists as a potentially important process for closing the marine mass balance of some elements.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Sulfur isotope studies of post-Archean terrestrial materials have focused on the ratio 34S/32S because additional isotopes, 33S and 36S, were thought to carry little information beyond the well-known mass-dependent relationship among multiple-isotope ratios. We report high-precision analyses of ??33S and ??36S values, defined as deviations of 33S and 36S from ideal mass-dependent relationships, for international reference materials and sedimentary sulfides of Phanerozoic age by using a fluorination technique with a dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Measured variations in ??33S and ??36S are explained as resulting from processes involve branching reactions (two or more reservoirs formed) or mixing. Irreversible processes in closed systems (Rayleigh distillation) amplify the isotope effect. We outline how this new isotope proxy can be used to gain new insights into fundamental aspects of the sulfur biogeochemical cycle, including additional constraints on seawater sulfate budget and processes in sedimentary sulfide formation. The isotope systematics discussed here cannot explain the much larger variation of ??33S and ??36S observed in Archean rock records. Furthermore, Phanerozoic samples we have studied show a characteristic ??33S and ??36S relationship that differs from those measured in Archean rocks and laboratory photolysis experiments. Thus, high precision analysis of ??33S and ??36S can be used to distinguish small non-zero ??33S and ??36S produced by mass-dependent processes from those produced by mass-independent processes in Archean rocks and extraterrestrial materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Constraining the carbon isotopic changes associated with the end-Triassic mass extinction is key to understanding the causes of the extinction and dynamics of recovery from it. Yet the pattern and timing of {\&}{\#}948;13C variation surrounding the extinction remain poorly constrained. Here we present close to 1000 new {\&}{\#}948;13C measurements from six newly sampled sections in Italy. We observe a sharp negative excursion in {\&}{\#}948;13Ccarb coincident with the disappearance of the Triassic fauna, and two positive excursions above it. The negative {\&}{\#}948;13Ccarb excursion in these sections does not occur in {\&}{\#}948;13Corg suggesting a possible diagenetic origin. In contrast, the interval of elevated {\&}{\#}948;13C occurs in both carbonate and organic carbon, suggesting that it is likely to be a primary feature. The positive excursions in the Lombardy Basin (southern Alps) and Mt. Cefalo (southern Apennines) appear to be time correlative on the basis of their position above the disappearance of characteristically Triassic biota. However, it is less certain that they are time correlative with positive excursions in other sections worldwide, as few options exist that honor both bio- and chemostratigraphy. Nonetheless, similarity to other events that are interpreted as global, as well as carbon cycle considerations, suggest that the isotopic enrichment is best interpreted to reflect a shift in the isotope composition of the global surface carbon reservoir. Our data indicate that perturbation of the global carbon cycle was not confined to the immediate vicinity of the extinction interval, but rather persisted for substantial length of geologic time afterwards.},

abstract = {High-resolution stratigraphic records through the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) interval of the global stratotype section and point (GSSP) at Meishan, Zhejiang Province, China reveal that the PTB crisis was not a single, abrupt catastrophe. A bed-by-bed analysis of environmental and biotic changes makes clear that the crisis can be resolved into two discrete episodes, each consisting of three stages: A) unstably oscillating conditions, B) peak crisis conditions, and C) ameliorating conditions. The first crisis episode commenced in Bed 23, peaked in Beds 24e-26, and ameliorated in Beds 27 and 28, while the second crisis episode commenced in Bed 29, peaked in Beds 34-38, and ameliorated in Beds 39 and higher. The macroscopic mass extinctions happened not at the beginning, nor the end of each cycle, but at times when the crisis or perturbation of environments began. These extinction events do not show detectable feedbacks to concurrent environmental changes. In each episode, cyanobacteria proliferation postdated the macroscopic extinction while proliferation of green sulfur bacteria predated the environmental crisis. Causational analysis between environmental and microbial changes show that geomicrobial functional groups exercised pronounced effects on the marine C-N-S cycles and ocean redox conditions during the PTB crisis. It is possible thus that the microbial crises played an important role in strengthening or evening triggering the environmental crisis. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Brilon-reef complex is one of the biggest Devonian carbonate buildups ({\~{}}80 km2) of the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge. The Burgberg section is located in the southeastern fore-reef area of the Brilon Reef Complex and exposes a succession of strata (117 m thick), which extends from the Middle Givetian (middle varcus conodont Zone) to the Vis{\'{e}}an (bilineatus conodont Zone). Field and microfacies observations led to the definition of nine microfacies that are integrated into a sedimentary model divided into off-reef, intermediate fore-reef, and proximal fore-reef sedimentary domains (SD). The off-reef domain (SD1) is the most distal setting observed and is characterized by fine-grained sediments, dominated by pelagic biota and the local occurrence of gravity-flow deposits. The intermediate fore-reef (SD2) is characterized by a mixture of biota and sediments coming from both deeper-water and shallow-water sources and is influenced by storm and gravity-flow currents. In this domain, Renalcis mound-like structures developed locally. Finally, the proximal fore-reef (SD3) corresponds to the most proximal setting that is strongly influenced by gravity-flow currents derived from the Brilon Reef Complex. The temporal evolution of microfacies in the fore-reef setting of the Burgberg section show five main paleoenvironmental trends influenced by the onset, general development, and demise/drowning of the Brilon Reef Complex. Fore-reef to off-reef lithologies and their temporal changes are from the base to the top of the section: (U1)-fine-grained sediments with large reef debris, corresponding to the initial development of the reef building upon submarine volcaniclastic deposits during the Middle Givetian (middle varcus Zone) and first export of reef debris in the fore-reef setting; (U2)-high increase of reef-derived material in the fore-reef area, corresponding to a significant progradation of the reef from the Middle Givetian to the Early Frasnian (maximum extension of the Brilon Reef Complex to the south, disparilis to the falsiovalis conodont biozones); (U3)-progressive decrease of shallow-water derived material and increase of fine-grained sediments and deep-water biota into the fore-reef setting, corresponding to the stepwise withdrawal of the reef influence; from the Middle to the Late Frasnian (jamieae conodont Zone); (U4)-development of a submarine rise characterized by nodular and cephalopod-bearing limestones extending from the Late Frasnian to the Late Famennian corresponding to the demise and drowning of the Brilon Reef Complex as a result of the Late Frasnian Kellwasser events (upper rhenana and triangularis conodont biozones); (U5)-significant deepening of the Burgberg area starting in the Late Famennian, directly followed by an aggrading trend marked by pelagic shales overlying the nodular limestone deposits. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The first feature apparently originates due to complex organic material on their surfaces, but the origin of the material contributing to low albedo is not well understood. Titan tholins synthesized to simulate aerosols in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan have also been used for simulating the NIR reflectances of several Centaurs and TNOs. Here, we report novel detections of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nanoscopic soot aggregates and cauliflower-like graphite within Titan tholins. We put forth a proof of concept stating the surfaces of Centaurs and TNOs may perhaps comprise of highly ‘carbonized' complex organic material, analogous to the tholins we investigated. Such material would apparently be capable of contributing to the NIR reflectances and to the low geometric albedos simultaneously.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The detection of diagenetic alteration is critical for palaeoclimate reconstruction that is based on the oxygen isotope composition of fossil bones and teeth. So far, no direct chemical proxy has been found to track diagenetic modification of the oxygen isotope ratios. Here, a new approach to identify diagenetic changes of $\delta$18OPO4 values in skeletal apatite of small mammals by means of triple oxygen isotope analysis (16O, 17O and18O) is presented. Our method is based on the fact that inhaled air oxygen (O2) has an isotope anomaly on its rare isotope 17O. Inhaled air O2 is a major source of oxygen in small land-living mammals. A fraction of the anomaly is transferred via body water to skeletal apatite, where it can be detected by means of $\delta$17O and $\delta$18O analyses. The approach, considering the current analytical uncertainty, is restricted to small mammals with body masses≤1 kg. This is due to the low specific metabolic rates of large mammals, resulting in a lower fraction of oxygen inhaled via breathing relative to oxygen from other sources in their body water. Remnant negative 17O anomalies derived from in vivo inhaled O2 have been detected in enamel bioapatite of Eocene to Miocene rodent teeth while dentine of the same teeth lacks significant 17O anomalies. This suggests preservation of the original phosphate oxygen isotope composition in enamel of these smallmammal teeth. In contrast, 17O anomalies in dentine have been erased due to diagenetic alteration with isotopically normal diagenetic fluids. Triple oxygen isotope analysis of bioapatite thus seems to be a useful new proxy to directly detect diagenetic alterations of the $\delta$18OPO4 values of small mammal teeth.},

abstract = {High-resolution carbon isotope records of organic carbon ([delta]13Corg) across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) from the expanded sections of the Tr{\o}ndelag and Finnmark platforms in Norway demonstrate that the negative carbon isotope excursion around the PTB begins with a stepwise 8[per mille sign] negative decline to a first minimum. After a subsequent positive excursion, a second minimum follows in the basal Griesbachian. Particulate organic matter (POM) is dominated by terrestrial particles with changing marine contributions. Intervals with minor C-isotope fluctuations coincide with homogeneous terrestrial POM assemblages, whereas intervals with pronounced C-isotope fluctuations correspond to heterogeneous marine-terrestrial POM assemblages, suggesting that the C-isotope curve represents a global signal with superimposed local variations of carbon sources. The [delta]13Corg of the contributing organic carbon ranges from - 32[per mille sign] (marine organic carbon) to - 22[per mille sign] (terrestrial organic carbon). Comparison of the new record, divided into 10 chemostratigraphic intervals with other, globally distributed sections suggests the presence of gaps in several classical PTB sections. Detailed chemostratigraphic correlation reveals that the extinction of marine organisms occurred during the stepwise negative shift and the end-Permian floral turnover occurred prior to the first C-isotope minimum. The correlation also shows that the marker of the recently defined Global Stratotype Section and Point PTB occurs within a broad interval ranging from most negative [delta]13C values up to the subsequent isotopic increase.},

@article{Ridgwell2003,
abstract = {1 One of the most elegant mechanisms forwarded for late Quaternary atmospheric CO2 variability concerns the sensitivity of calcium carbonate preservation in deep ocean sediments to the relative delivery rates of calcium carbonate and particulate organic carbon (the CaCO3: POC "rain ratio''). It was implicitly assumed that any change in the CaCO3: POC rain ratio of biogenic material produced in the surface ocean will be communicated directly to the sediments. This would allow relatively subtle shifts in ecosystem composition to affect sedimentary CaCO3 preservation and thus atmospheric CO2). However, recent research into the controls on the transport of POC to depth suggests that the rain ratio "seen'' by the sediments may instead be buffered against any perturbation occurring at the surface. This casts doubt on the viability of hypotheses envisaging ecological changes as a means of accounting for the observed glacial-interglacial CO2 signal.},

@article{Naehr2007,
abstract = {Authigenic carbonates from five continental margin locations, the Eel River Basin, Monterey Bay, Santa Barbara Basin, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the North Sea, exhibit a wide range of mineralogical and stable isotopic compositions. These precipitates include aragonite, low- and high-Mg calcite, and dolomite. The carbon isotopic composition of carbonates varies widely, ranging from -60??? to +26???, indicating complex carbon sources that include 13C-depleted microbial and thermogenic methane and residual, 13C-enriched, bicarbonate. A similarly large variability of ??18O values (-5.5??? to +8.9???) demonstrates the geochemical complexity of these sites, with some samples pointing toward an 18O-enriched oxygen source possibly related to advection of 18O-enriched formation water or to the decomposition of gas hydrate. Samples depleted in 18O are consistent with formation deeper in the sediment or mixing of pore fluids with meteoric water during carbonate precipitation. A wide range of isotopic and mineralogical variation in authigenic carbonate composition within individual study areas but common trends across multiple geographic areas suggest that these parameters alone are not indicative for certain tectonic or geochemical settings. Rather, the observed variations probably reflect local controls on the flux of carbon and other reduced ions, such as faults, fluid conduits, the presence or absence of gas hydrate in the sediment, and the temporal evolution of the local carbon reservoir. Areas with seafloor carbonates that indicate formation at greater depth below the sediment-water interface must have undergone uplift and erosion in the past or are still being uplifted. Consequently, the occurrence of carbonate slabs on the seafloor in areas of active hydrocarbon seepage is commonly an indicator of exhumation following carbonate precipitation in the shallow subsurface. Therefore, careful petrographic and geochemical analyses are critical components necessary for the correct interpretation of processes related to hydrocarbon seepage in continental margin environments and elsewhere. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Interstitial water samples from seven ODP sites (Leg 181, Sites 1119-1125) of the southwestern Pacific Ocean have been analyzed for the stable sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate along with major and minor ions. Sulfate from the interstitial fluids ($\delta$34S values between +20. 7 and +60‰ vs. the SO2-based Vienna-Canyon Diablo troilite standard) was enriched in 34S with respect to modern sea water ($\delta$34S≈+20.6‰) indicating that microbial sulfate reduction takes place to different extents at all investigated sites. Microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) was found at all sites, the intensity depending on the availability of organic matter which is controlled by paleo-sedimentation conditions (sedimentation rate, presence of turbidites) and productivity. Microbial net sulfate reduction was additionally confirmed by modeling interstitial water sulfate profiles. Areal net sulfate reduction rates up to 14 mmol m-2 yr-1 have been calculated which were positively related to sedimentation rates. Total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS; essentially pyrite) as a product of microbial sulfate reduction was isotopically characterized in squeeze cake samples and gave $\delta$ 34S values between -51 and +9‰ indicating pyrite formation both close to the sediment-water interface and later diagenetic contributions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Testing of the predictions was based on those Precambrian seafloor carbonate precipitates that have been interpreted by others to have formed originally as aragonite. Of 16 examples of Precambrian seafloor aragonite, 14 fall within the 6 periods of aragonite seas predicted for the Late Archean-Proterozoic by the model, 1 falls on the transition between an aragonite sea and calcite sea, and 1 falls in a period of calcite seas. This strong correlation supports the following predictions of the model: (1) Precambrian seawater was a saline NaCl water with Ca {\textgreater} HCO3 since at least the Late Archean. (2) The major ion compositions of Precambrian seawater chemistry and their secular variations are in the same ranges as those of Phanerozoic seawater.

abstract = {The ocean and atmosphere were largely anoxic in the early Precambrian, resulting in an Fe cycle that was dramatically different than today's. Extremely Fe-rich sedimentary deposits-i.e., Fe formations-are the most conspicuous manifestation of this distinct Fe cycle. Rare Earth Element (REE) systematics have long been used as a tool to understand the origin of Fe formations and the corresponding chemistry of the ancient ocean. However, many earlier REE studies of Fe formations have drawn ambiguous conclusions, partially due to analytical limitations and sampling from severely altered units. Here, we present new chemical analyses of Fe formation samples from 18 units, ranging in age from ca. 3.0 to 1.8 billion years old (Ga), which allow a reevaluation of the depositional mechanisms and significance of Precambrian Fe formations. There are several temporal trends in our REE and Y dataset that reflect shifts in marine redox conditions. In general, Archean Fe formations do not display significant shale-normalized negative Ce anomalies, and only Fe formations younger than 1.9. Ga display prominent positive Ce anomalies. Low Y/Ho ratios and high shale-normalized light to heavy REE (LREE/HREE) ratios are also present in ca. 1.9. Ga and younger Fe formations but are essentially absent in their Archean counterparts. These marked differences in Paleoproterozoic versus Archean REE. +. Y patterns can be explained in terms of varying REE cycling in the water column. Similar to modern redox-stratified basins, the REE. +. Y patterns in late Paleoproterozoic Fe formations record evidence of a shuttle of metal and Ce oxides across the redoxcline from oxic shallow seawater to deeper anoxic waters. Oxide dissolution-mainly of Mn oxides-in an anoxic water column lowers the dissolved Y/Ho ratio, raises the light to heavy REE ratio, and increases the concentration of Ce relative to the neighboring REE (La and Pr). Fe oxides precipitating at or near the chemocline will capture these REE anomalies and thus evidence for this oxide shuttle. In contrast, Archean Fe formations do not display REE. +. Y patterns indicative of an oxide shuttle, which implies an absence of a distinct Mn redoxcline prior to the rise of atmospheric oxygen in the early Paleoproterozoic. As further evidence for reducing conditions in shallow-water environments of the Archean ocean, REE data for carbonates deposited on shallow-water Archean carbonate platforms that stratigraphically underlie Fe formations also lack negative Ce anomalies. These results question classical models for deposition of Archean Fe formations that invoke oxidation by free oxygen at or above a redoxcline. In contrast, we add to growing evidence that metabolic Fe oxidation is a more likely oxidative mechanism for these Fe formations, implying that the Fe distribution in Archean oceans could have been controlled by microbial Fe uptake rather than the oxidative potential of shallow-marine environments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although the change appears to record a larger proportion of land-derived material in younger sediments, bulk [delta]13Corg values indicate a predominance of marine origin for organic matter throughout the sequence. Marine paleoproductivity, as represented by mass accumulation rates of CaCO3 and organic carbon, increased over this time interval. We postulate that the larger Corganic/Ntotal values record a shift towards greater recycling rates of nitrogen-rich, relative to carbon-rich, organic matter components as the flux of total organic matter to the seafloor increased. Furthermore, we propose that high Corganic/Ntotal values may record enhanced paleoproductivity in other sedimentary sequences dominated by marine organic matter.},

abstract = {The evolution of Earth's biota is intimately linked to the oxygenation of the oceans and atmosphere. We use the isotopic composition and concentration of molybdenum (Mo) in sedimentary rocks to explore this relationship. Our results indicate two episodes of global ocean oxygenation. The first coincides with the emergence of the Ediacaran fauna, including large, motile bilaterian animals, ca. 550-560 million year ago (Ma), reinforcing previous geochemical indications that Earth surface oxygenation facilitated this radiation. The second, perhaps larger, oxygenation took place around 400 Ma, well after the initial rise of animals and, therefore, suggesting that early metazoans evolved in a relatively low oxygen environment. This later oxygenation correlates with the diversification of vascular plants, which likely contributed to increased oxygenation through the enhanced burial of organic carbon in sediments. It also correlates with a pronounced radiation of large predatory fish, animals with high oxygen demand. We thereby couple the redox history of the atmosphere and oceans to major events in animal evolution.},

The fossil record provides rich information on past extinctions that can help predict biotic responses. We show that over 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of extinction risk variation in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk-extinction risk predicted by paleontologically calibrated models-for modern genera in these groups. Mapping the geographic distribution of these genera identifies coastal biogeographic provinces where fauna with high intrinsic risk are strongly affected by human activity or climate change. Such regions are disproportionately in the tropics, raising the possibility that these ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to future extinctions. Intrinsic risk provides a prehuman baseline for considering current threats to marine biodiversity.},

abstract = {Understanding a planet's atmosphere is a necessary condition for understanding not only the planet itself, but also its formation, structure, evolution, and habitability. This requirement puts a premium on obtaining spectra and developing credible interpretative tools with which to retrieve vital planetary information. However, for exoplanets, these twin goals are far from being realized. In this paper, I provide a personal perspective on exoplanet theory and remote sensing via photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy. Although not a review in any sense, this paper highlights the limitations in our knowledge of compositions, thermal profiles, and the effects of stellar irradiation, focusing on, but not restricted to, transiting giant planets. I suggest that the true function of the recent past of exoplanet atmospheric research has been not to constrain planet properties for all time, but to train a new generation of scientists who, by rapid trial and error, are fast establishing a solid future foundation for a robust science of exoplanets.},

abstract = {Ocean anoxic events were periods of high carbon burial that led to drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering of bottom-water oxygen concentrations and, in many cases, significant biological extinction. Most ocean anoxic events are thought to be caused by high productivity and export of carbon from surface waters which is then preserved in organic-rich sediments, known as black shales. But the factors that triggered some of these events remain uncertain. Here we present stable isotope data from a mid-Cretaceous ocean anoxic event that occurred 112 Myr ago, and that point to increased thermohaline stratification as the probable cause. Ocean anoxic event 1b is associated with an increase in surface-water temperatures and runoff that led to decreased bottom-water formation and elevated carbon burial in the restricted basins of the western Tethys and North Atlantic. This event is in many ways similar to that which led to the more recent Plio-Pleistocene Mediterranean sapropels, but the greater geographical extent and longer duration (approximately 46 kyr) of ocean anoxic event 1b suggest that processes leading to such ocean anoxic events in the North Atlantic and western Tethys were able to act over a much larger region, and sequester far more carbon, than any of the Quaternary sapropels.},

abstract = {The intramolecular kinetic oxygen isotope fractionation between CO2 and CO3
2- during reaction of phosphoric acid with natural smithsonite (ZnCO3) and cerussite (PbCO3) has been determined between 25 and 72??C. While cerussite decomposes in phosphoric acid within a few hours at 25??C, smithsonite reacts very slowly with the acid at 25??C providing yields of CO2 {\textless} 25{\%} after 2 weeks. The low yields result in a low precision for oxygen isotope measurements of the acid-liberated CO2 (??1.65???, 1??, n = 9). The yield and reproducibility of oxygen isotope values of the acid-liberated CO2 from smithsonite can be improved, the latter to ?????0.15???, by increasing the reaction temperature to 50??C for 12 h or to 72??C for 1 h. Our new phosphoric acid fractionation factor for natural cerussite at 25??C deviates significantly from a previously published value on synthetic material. The temperature dependence of the oxygen isotope factionation factor, ?? between acid-liberated CO2 and carbonate at 25 to 72??C is given by the following equations 1000ln?? phosCO2-cerussite = 5.13 (??0.15) + 4.79 (??0.15) ?? 105/T2 1000ln?? phosCO2-smithsonite = 3.96 (??0.21) + 6.69 (??0.22) ?? 105/T2 with temperature T in kelvin. A comparison with published equations of the form 1000ln??phosCO2-carbonate = A + B ?? 105/T2 for other divalent metal carbonates shows that the factors B of slowly-reacting carbonates from the rhombohedral calcite group (magnesite, siderite, smithsonite and rhodochrosite) are very similar (6.7 ?? 0.2) and distinct from those of fast-reacting minerals witherite, cerussite, and strontianite of the orthorhombic aragonite group (4.5 ?? 0.3) and calcite (5.6 ?? 0.1). These differences indicate a crystallographic control on the temperature dependence of the kinetic oxygen isotope fractionation between phosphoric acid liberated CO2 and carbonate. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

Eight basic requirements and challenges for a multi-proxy study are outlined in this essay - definition of research questions, leadership, site selection and coring, data storage, chronology, presentation of results, numerical tools and data interpretation. The nature of proxy data is discussed in terms of physical proxies and biotic proxies. Loss-on-ignition changes and the use of transfer functions are reviewed as examples of problems in the interpretation of data from multi-proxy studies. The importance of pollen analysis and plant macrofossil analysis in multi-proxy studies is emphasised as lake history cannot be interpreted without knowledge of catchment history. Future directions are outlined about how multi-proxy studies can contribute to understanding biotic responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {A new Raman spectroscopic technique has been refined to more efficiently determine the crystallinity indeces of biogenic apatites. We investigate the possible relationships between the structure (crystallinity) and geochemistry (rare earth element (REE), $\delta$18O) of biogenic apatites. A selection of phosphatic remains dated from present to about 510 Ma (Late Cambrian), for most of which either the oxygen isotope compositions or REE patterns are available, has been characterized for crystallinity using Raman spectroscopy. We define a new crystallinity index (CIRaman) from the ratio of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the intense peak of the PO4 symmetric stretching mode in the sample and a reference magmatic apatite. In order to compare our crystallinity index with CI used in previously published studies, we also analyzed part of our sample set with FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. A detailed study of natural samples demonstrates that crystallinity index is a poor criterion for determining if a sample has been altered since deposition. This result is based on three major observations: (1) independently of the CIRaman, the original geochemical signatures of the biogenic apatites can be preserved over a long period, (2) strong geochemical perturbations (lowering of $\delta$18O values and of La/Sm ratios) may occur without detectable recrystallization, and (3) alteration by heating, marked by the transformation of organic matter into graphite, produces REE fractionations and limited oxygen isotope exchange with crustal aqueous fluids.},

I synthesized published studies in order to estimate a global mean extinction rate and determine which factors contribute the greatest uncertainty to climate change–induced extinction risks. Results suggest that extinction risks will accelerate with future global temperatures, threatening up to one in six species under current policies. Extinction risks were highest in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, and risks did not vary by taxonomic group. Realistic assumptions about extinction debt and dispersal capacity substantially increased extinction risks. We urgently need to adopt strategies that limit further climate change if we are to avoid an acceleration of global extinctions.},

abstract = {The Mn distribution in Panama Basin area sediments and interstitial waters is discussed. Striking surficial Mn enrichments produced by a well-known diagenetic recycling process characterize the sediments of the region. Thermodynamic solubility calculations indicate that in at least one core interstitial waters approach saturation with respect to MnCO3. A mixed carbonate phase of composition (Mn48 Ca47 Mg5)CO3 was recovered from an ash band in the same core. The association of this material with the coarse volcaniclastic debris is thought to result from facile manganous carbonate precipitation in sediment horizons of coarser mean grain size. Since sulphate reduction in the upper two metres of Panama Basin sediments is fairly minor, little increase in alkalinity is observed, and it is postulated that significant production of carbonate alkalinity is not a prerequisite for manganous carbonate generation in hemipelagic sediments. A more important factor appears to be the availability of Mn oxides for solution during early diagenesis. Stable C isotopic analyses indicate that little C of organic origin is used in the precipitation reaction in either Panama Basin or Loch Fyne (Scotland) sediments.},

Rudist skeletal components with preserved original mineralogy of aragonite and {\{}low-Mg{\}} calcite, and with preserved microstructures, have isotopic signatures analogous to Holocene marine bivalves. This similarity argues for a comparable isotopic composition of the Cretaceous and Holocene seawater, as well as for a similar mode of incorporation of stable isotopes into their shells.

The direct A --{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} {\{}dLMC{\}} mineralogical transformation (= calcitization) results in initial depletion in 18 O of {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}=2 per thousand and the subsequent diagenetic precipitation of ferroan calcite spar causes depletion in 13 C as well as an additional decrease in 18 O; the former due to introduction of organically derived {\{}CO{\}} 2 into the diagenetic aquifer. In contrast, 13 O and 13 C isotopic depletions in the originally {\{}LMC{\}} skeletal components are both related to the precipitation of the late diagenetic ferroan sparry calcite cement, the earlier calcitization stage being of subordinate importance only.},

abstract = {Focusing on the Permian-Triassic boundary, ca. 251 Ma, I explore the possibility that mass extinction can be caused by an extremely fast, explosive release of dissolved methane (and other dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) that accumulated in the oceanic water masses prone to stagnation and anoxia (e.g., in silled basins). The mechanism of the explosive release is the same as in the Lake Nyos disaster of 1986, i.e., a water-column eruption caused by the interplay of buoyancy forces and exsolution of dissolved gas. The eruption brings to the surface deep anoxic waters that cause extinctions in the marine realm. Terrestrial extinctions are caused by explosions and conflagrations that follow the massive release of methane (the air-methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5{\%} and 15{\%}) and by the eruption-triggered floods. This scenario accounts well for the available data, and may be relevant to other phenomena.},

abstract = {Ocean stagnation has been invoked to explain the widespread occurrence of organic-carbon-rich, laminated sediments interpreted to have been deposited under anoxic bottom waters at the time of the end-Permian mass extinction. However, to a first approximation, stagnation would severely reduce the upwelling supply of nutrients to the photic zone, reducing productivity. Moreover, it is not obvious that ocean stagnation can be achieved. Numerical experiments performed with st three-dimensional global ocean model linked to a biogeochemical model of phosphate and oxygen cycling indicate that a low equator to pole temperature gradient could have produced weak oceanic circulation and widespread anoxia in the Late Permian ocean. We find that polar warming and tropical cooling of sea-surface temperatures cause anoxia throughout the deep ocean as a result of both lower dissolved oxygen in bottom source waters and increased nutrient utilization. Buildup of quantities of H2S and CO2 in the Late Permian ocean sufficient to directly cause a mass extinction, however, would have required large increases in the oceanic nutrient inventory.},

abstract = {Depth profiles of the stable sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate in near-surface sediments were measured at five stations of the deep Arabian Sea between 1918 and 4426 m water depth (WAST, WAST-Top, CAST, SAST, NAST), sampled in April 1997. The results clearly indicate that net microbial sulfate reduction took place in the sediments at stations WAST and NAST below about 12 cm depth. Sulfate reduction at WAST was more pronounced compared to station NAST, most likely due to higher organic carbon content in turbiditic sediments. No net sulfate reduction took place within the upper 10 cm of the surface sediments at all stations, and no significant isotopic indication for sulfate reduction was found down to 30 cm bsf at station SAST. Results are in accordance with accumulation of reduced isotopically light sulfur species below about 6 cm bsf at station WAST. It is concluded that the sulfur isotopic composition of remaining sulfate is more sensitive to net sulfate reduction than the [SO4]/[Cl] ratio. The sulfur isotopic composition of a vertical profile for dissolved sulfate through the water column at station WAST was essentially constant (250-4047 m: $\delta$34S = + 20.49 ± 0.08{\%}0 VS. V-CDT n = 8). A similar constancy (20-4565 m water depth $\delta$34S = + 20.57 ± 0.06{\%}0 VS. V-CDT n = 15) was found for the station BIOTRANS in the northeastern Atlantic (47°11' 19°33W), indicating that the oxygen minimum zone in the Arabian Sea has no influence on the sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate.

abstract = {Two Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) sections from south China provide insights regarding the origin of negative excursions in carbonate and organic carbon isotope records associated with the largest mass extinction in Earth history. Xiakou, a carbonate ramp section, exhibits $\delta$13Ccarb excursions of up to –2‰, and Xinmin, a deep-shelf section, exhibits $\delta$13Corg excursions of up to –6‰. In both sections, these excursions are associated with volcanic ash layers, and excursion size scales with ash layer thickness. These relationships document the direct influence of volcanism on the Earth-surface carbon cycle during the PTB crisis. Previous studies of ash layers in south China PTB sections have invoked a source in regional subduction-zone volcanism in the eastern Tethys, but our analysis suggests that these ash layers may represent distal deposits from large-scale explosive eruptions of the Siberian Traps. If confirmed by further investigation, this hypothesis would have important implications both for kill mechanisms during the PTB crisis as well as for refinement of the eruption history of the Siberian Traps.},

The results are compared with the chemistry, and $\delta$13C and 87Sr/86Sr values of the associated porewater. Petrographic relationships indicate that dolomite forms as a primary precipitate in porous diatom ooze and siliciclastic sediment and is not replacing the small amounts of precursor carbonate. Dolomite precipitation often pre-dates the formation of framboidal pyrite. Most dolomite layers show 87Sr/86Sr-ratios similar to the composition of Quaternary seawater and do not indicate a contribution from the hypersaline brine, which is present at a greater burial depth. Also, the $\delta$13C values of the dolomite are not in equilibrium with the $\delta$13C values of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the associated modern porewater. Both petrography and 87Sr/86Sr ratios suggest a shallow depth of dolomite formation in the uppermost sediment ({\textless}30 m below the seafloor). A significant depletion in the dissolved Mg and Ca in the porewater constrains the present site of dolomite precipitation, which co-occurs with a sharp increase in alkalinity and microbial cell concentration at the sulphate–methane interface. It has been hypothesized that microbial ‘hot-spots', such as the sulphate–methane interface, may act as focused sites of dolomite precipitation. Varying $\delta$13C values from −15‰ to +15‰ for the dolomite are consistent with precipitation at a dynamic sulphate–methane interface, where $\delta$13C of the dissolved inorganic carbon would likewise be variable. A dynamic deep biosphere with upward and downward migration of the sulphate–methane interface can be simulated using a simple numerical diffusion model for sulphate concentration in a sedimentary sequence with variable input of organic matter. Thus, the study of dolomite layers in ancient organic carbon-rich sedimentary sequences can provide a useful window into the palaeo-dynamics of the deep biosphere.},

abstract = {A wide range of sulphate sulphur isotope data has previously been reported for the late Neoproterozoic and early Cambrian (∼600 to 542 Ma), whereas hardly any data exists with respect to the isotopic composition of sulphate oxygen for this time period. Thus, a refinement of the seawater sulphate records for $\delta$SSO434 and $\delta$OSO418 at this time, following an evaluation of the diagenetic history of the studied sediments, can contribute to a better understanding of ocean chemistry. For this purpose $\delta$34S and $\delta$18O of sulphate was measured in phosphorites and carbonates from different paleoenvironmental settings within the Yangtze Platform in China. Fe speciation was also applied in order to constrain water column redox conditions. A number of secondary processes in pore waters are identified by combining sulphate $\delta$34S with sulphate $\delta$18O, pyrite $\delta$34S and Fe speciation. Some samples are characterized by comparably low $\delta$18O and $\delta$SSO434, attributed to preferential incorporation of H2O oxygen during sulphide oxidation. Other samples have elevated oxygen and sulphur isotope values, implying not only bacterial sulphate reduction under closed conditions with respect to sulphate availability, but also bacterial disproportionation of intermediate sulphur species. Samples exhibiting no apparent diagenetic overprint give a range in $\delta$OSO418 of between 13 and 15‰ for the sulphate oxygen isotopic composition of Ediacaran to early Atdabanian seawater. For the post-glacial Ediacaran stage, seawater $\delta$SSO434 values of around 34‰ are indicated, with a possible decrease to ∼25‰ in the late Ediacaran Dengying Formation, due to influx of 34S depleted sulphate driven from oxidised sulphide, and a possible decrease in pyrite burial. A rise in $\delta$SSO434 to ca. 40‰ in the early Cambrian may be connected to more pronounced basinal euxinia and an enhanced draw-down of 32S via intense bacterial sulphate reduction in the water column. This rise in 34S is not accompanied by an increase in $\delta$OSO418, which could reflect a change in either the oxidation mechanism of SO4 or an oceanic fluctuation in $\delta$18O. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Systematic sulfur isotope data for whole-rock sulfides have been obtained from the chert-dominated, continuous, pelagic sedimentary sequences spanning the Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary at Tenjinmaru in the Chichibu Terrane and at Sasayama in the Tanba Terrane in Japan. The P/Tr boundary is characterized by the occurrence of siliceous shales in association with a carbonaceous black mudstone which is similar in appearance to the worldwide distributed Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary claystone. The observed data clearly demonstrate a significant bimodalism. The 34S/32S ratios with respect to CDT are generally low throughout the Middle Permian (ca.−39 to −25{\%}0) and show a remarkable increase beginning in the lower Upper Permian and persisting into the Lower Triassic (ca.−20 to −2{\%}0), with a temporary and drastic negative shift, down to roughly the same isotopic level as in the Middle Permian, just at the suspected P/Tr boundary (ca.−41 to −23{\%}0). Interestingly, the mode of isotopic excursion across the P/Tr boundary is in striking contrast to that across the K/T boundary which was recently described at Kawaruppu in Hokkado, Japan. The apparent extent of fractionation, with respect to contemporaneous seawater sulfate, in the high 34S/32S group lies within the range of −25 ± 10{\%}0, which is quantitatively equivalent to the currently confirmed range of kinetic isotope effect during bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and that in the low 34S/32S group mostly exceeds this range, giving the values typically in the range of −45 ± 10{\%}0, which is similar to what is generally observed in the present-day oceanic sediments. The present data would provide strong evidence for the development of a largely stagnant, anoxic, stratified ocean, which presumably began to form in the lower Upper Permian and persisted into the Lower Triassic, and for a brief episode of its temporary massive mixing just at the suspected P/Tr boundary. Such an oceanic oxic-anoxic history may account to some extent for the relatively high enrichments of chalcophile elements in basal Triassic sediments in the world and add a significant constraint to the current arguments on the cause and consequence of the terminal Permian mass extinction.},

abstract = {Many aspects of Earth's early sulfur cycle, from the origin of mass-anomalous fractionations to the degree of biological participation, remain poorly understood--in part due to complications from postdepositional diagenetic and metamorphic processes. Using a combination of scanning high-resolution magnetic superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of sulfur isotopes ((32)S, (33)S, and (34)S), we examined drill core samples from slope and basinal environments adjacent to a major Late Archean (∼2.6-2.5 Ga) marine carbonate platform from South Africa. Coupled with petrography, these techniques can untangle the complex history of mineralization in samples containing diverse sulfur-bearing phases. We focused on pyrite nodules, precipitated in shallow sediments. These textures record systematic spatial differences in both mass-dependent and mass-anomalous sulfur-isotopic composition over length scales of even a few hundred microns. Petrography and magnetic imaging demonstrate that mass-anomalous fractionations were acquired before burial and compaction, but also show evidence of postdepositional alteration 500 million y after deposition. Using magnetic imaging to screen for primary phases, we observed large spatial gradients in $\Delta$(33)S ({\textgreater}4‰) in nodules, pointing to substantial environmental heterogeneity and dynamic mixing of sulfur pools on geologically rapid timescales. In other nodules, large systematic radial $\delta$(34)S gradients ({\textgreater}20‰) were observed, from low values near their centers increasing to high values near their rims. These fractionations support hypotheses that microbial sulfate reduction was an important metabolism in organic-rich Archean environments--even in an Archean ocean basin dominated by iron chemistry.},

abstract = {New biogeochemical data redefined the position of the Permian−Triassic boundary (PTB) in the Velebit Mt., Croatia, previously positioned at the lithological boundary, and indicate two stress events. Pronounced enrichment in REE concentrations, negative Ce anomaly, negative shift in $\delta$13Cker values and disappearance of microfossils coincide with the occurrence of ooids, marking the first stress event, most probably the Late Permian regression. The second event is the PTB, with the well known negative shift in $\delta$13Ccarb from +1.4 to −0.6‰ (VPDB; P: −0.8 to +2‰; Tr: −1.3 to +0.9‰) and biota impoverishment. The $\delta$13Cker values at PTB are ∼−27.1‰, P: −27.3 to −24.4‰, and Tr: −29.1 to −26.4‰. The $\delta$15Nker values show a preferential marine influence during the Late Permian ({\~{}}7‰) before the regression phase, and enhanced terrestrial influence towards the PTB with presence of cyanobacteria (−2 to +4‰), which seems to be the only surviving taxa. Long chained n-alkanes (C17−C31, max. C26), with even/odd predominance are probably derived from the freshwater green microalga Botryococcus braunii, indicating lagoonal-type environment. The C17/C18 ratios show a stronger algal influence during Early Triassic. Prystane and phytane are present in most samples and they can be derived from chlorophyll in algae and cyanobacteria. The distribution of n-alkylcyclohexanes (C17−C24, max. C21) with even/odd predominance indicate a bacterial biomass contribution. Values of Pr/Ph ratio are mostly {\textless}1, probably indicating anoxic conditions. Hopanes, the prokaryota biomarkers, have been identified in almost all samples (C29 to C32), while steranes, biomarkers of eukaryotic organisms, have been found mostly in small abundances, in the range dia-C27 to ste- C29, usually maximizing at ste-C27, indicating marine input.},

A reservoir model for these carbonates involves extensive dolomitization and dissolution of metastable carbonate during repeated subaerial exposure. The reservoir model is confirmed by drilling and is accordingly regarded as low risk. Artinskian and Upper Permian shallow water carbonates deposited in a cold temperate climate were dominated by calcitic organisms and silica sponges, and associated with calcite cements and mud and chert. A reservoir model for these carbonates involves either preservation of primary porosity in carbonate build-ups or extensive dissolution of build-up marine cement during prolonged subaerial exposure. This model is not confirmed by drilling and is regarded as high risk.},

It provides an integrated view of cli- mate change as the final part of the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Re- port (AR4). Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef- fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre- sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un- der different scenarios. Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop- ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per- spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

abstract = {New analyses reveal two intervals of distinctly lower 13C values in the terrestrial organic matter of Permian-Triassic sequences in northern Xinjiang, China. The younger negative 13Corg spike can be correlated to the conspicuous and sharp 13C drops both in carbonate carbon and organic carbon near the Permian-Triassic event boundary (PTEB) in the marine section at Meishan. The geochemical correlation criteria are accompanied by a magnetic susceptibility pulse and higher abundances of distinctive, chain-like organic fossil remains of Reduviasporonites. The older negative 13Corg spike originates within a latest Permian regression. Significant changes in organic geochemical proxies are recorded in the equivalent interval of the marine section at Meishan. These include relatively higher concentrations of total organic carbon, isorenieratane, C14-C30 aryl isoprenoids and lower ratios of pristane/phytane that, together, indicate the onset of anoxic, euxinic and restricted environments within the photic zone. The massive and widespread oxidation of buried organic matter that induced these euxinic conditions in the ocean would also result in increased concentrations of 13C-depleted atmospheric CO2. The latest Permian environmental stress marked by the older negative 13Corg episode can be correlated with the distinct changeover of ostracod assemblages and the occurrences of morphological abnormalities of pollen grains. These observations imply that biogeochemical disturbance was manifested on the land at the end of the Permian and that terrestrial organisms responded to it before the main extinction of the marine fauna.  2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The most important Eurasian sections, where the transitional Permian/Triassic boundary beds are characterized palaeontologically, are found in the Germanic Basin (West European platform), Moscow Basin (East European platform), Tungusska Basin (Siberian platform), Jimsar Basin, Dalongkou area (Tianshan Mountains), and Noyan Somon depression (Mongolia). Usually the Permian and Triassic continental formations formed under distinct palaeogeographic (especially climatic) and palaeotectonic conditions, so the lithological and sedimentological differences between them are pronounced. Difficult problems appear in those regions where the sedimentation at this level proceeded under very similar conditions (Tungusska Basin, Jimsar Basin) across the Permo-Triassic boundary (PTB). Among palaeontological data, the most important for correlation of these continental beds is the tetrapod fauna. Broad interchange between the tetrapod fauna of the Old World continents resulted in the wide distribution during the Late Permian and Early Triassic of common or closely related forms, which enables distant correlations. The PTB is marked by the change of the Late Permian tetrapod communities, dominated by the large herbivore Dicynodon (or closely allied forms), to assemblages that include Lystrosaurus as the most common form. This is recorded in Lower Triassic beds of Eastern Europe, China, Mongolia, India and Siberia. The Upper Permian sporomorph associations (sa) are dominated by striate bissacate pollen, whereas the early Lower Triassic ones are distinguished by the very important role of spores, primarily by cavate trilete (Lundbladispora, Densoisporites) and also by non-striate dissacate (Klausipollenites) and teniate pollen (Lunatisporites). In the oldest horizons of the Triassic, very distinctive species of conchostracans (Falsisca eotriassica Kozur or the closely related form F. verhojanica Molin) appear. The PTB is within a normal polarity zone, formerly considered the lowest palaeomagnetic zone of the Triassic. The boundary beds of two sections (Moscow Basin and Jimsar Basin) may be equally worthy as candidates for the PTB GSSP in the continental series. The preference should be given to the section better characterized and internationally accessible to scientists. The PTB generally accepted for the continental series coincides more or less with the base of the Otoceras concavum ammonite zone of the Boreal province, and with the base of the boundary clay in Tethys. At the same time, it lies clearly below the traditionally adopted PTB in marine sequences at the base of the Otoceras woodwardi zone and also below the First Appearance Datum (FAD) of I. parva in the Meishan section, proposed now as the PTB GSSP (Yin, 1996, The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic Boundary Candidate of Global Stratotype Section and Point of the Permian-Triassic Boundary, China University Geoscience Press, Wuhan, 137 pp.). This demonstrates that the FAD of I. parva can be asynchronous (see Baud, 1996, Albertiana 18, pp. 6-9). That is why in the choice of the PTB GSSP in the marine series it is necessary to take into consideration the generally accepted point of view on the position of PTB in the continental series.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotopes of biogenic apatite have been widely used to reassess anomalous temperatures inferred from oxygen isotope ratios of ancient biogenic calcite, more prone to diagenetic alteration. However, recent studies have highlighted that oxygen isotope ratios of biogenic apatite differ dependent on used analytical techniques. This questions the applicability of the phosphate–water fractionation equations established over 25 years ago using earlier analytical techniques to more recently acquired data. In this work we present a new phosphate–water oxygen isotope fractionation equation based on oxygen isotopes determined on fish raised in aquariums at controlled temperature and with monitored water oxygen isotope composition. The new equation reveals a similar slope, but an offset of about + 2‰ to the earlier published equations. This work has major implications for paleoclimatic reconstructions using oxygen isotopes of biogenic apatite since calculated temperatures have been underestimated by about 4 to 8 °C depending on applied techniques and standardization of the analyses.},

abstract = {Our measurements of high-resolution spectra of Mars at 3.7 and 8 mu m revealed 200 lines of (OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-17, (OCO)-O-16- C-12-O-18, and (OCO)-O-16-C-13-O-18 isotopes. Among them are 38 lines which are absent in spectroscopic databases, Eighty lines of the three isotopes with closely equivalent widths were chosen to determine the oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in CO2. A radiation transfer code which coupled the reflected solar and thermal radiation was developed, This code divided the atmosphere into 30 layers and the Voigt profile of each line in each layer into 60 intervals. This results in a determination of the atmospheric pressure P-0 = 7.4 +/- 0.4 mbar and the isotope ratios O-18/O-17 = 0.914 +/- 0.04 and C- 13/C-12 = 0.94 +/- 0.15 scaled to CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. Scaling to SMOW gives O-18/O-17 = 0.93 +/- 0.04; assuming the same initial isotope ratio on Mars and Earth, we find that O-18/O-16 = 0.87 +/- 0.08 in CO2 on Mars. Oxygen and carbon isotope fractionation factors of 0.774 and 0.891 in the escape processes were calculated using individual heights of homopauses for different species. Oxygen and carbon isotope ratios are determined by the present water amount, the regolith-atmosphere-cap reservoir of CO2, the carbonate abundance, the initial abundance of CO2, and losses of H2O and CO2 by escape processes. Two processes affect the carbon isotope ratio in the atmosphere: formation of carbonates and sputtering of CO2. This ratio was calculated as a function of the CO2 sputtering after the end of impact erosion of the atmosphere at 0.8 byr. A weighted-mean value of C-13/C-12 = 0.97 +/- 0.05 (scaled to PDB) for three measurements in the martian atmosphere and determinations of the carbon isotope ratio in carbonates of the SNC meteorites require CO2 escape by sputtering to be smaller than 10 mbar. The oxygen isotope ratio could be depleted in water early in the history of Mars by water-silicate equilibrium; this does not contradict the isotopic composition of the SNC meteorites, Fractionation with CO2 and loss of CO2 by impact erosion depleted heavy oxygen in water as well. We calculated delta(18)O approximate to -70 parts per thousand in water vapor for preferred values of the initial CO2 of 7.5 bars, water escape of 30 m, and the present water ice reservoir of 500 m, Taking into account uncertainities of these values by a factor of 2-3, the expected minimum value of delta(18)O in water vapor is close to -110 parts per thousand and does not agree with some recent determinations. Heavy oxygen in CO2 should either be equal to that in water vapor (in the case of photochemical mixing) or exceed that in water vapor by 90 parts per thousand (in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium). Currently the calculated values of delta(18)O may serve as a guide to measured values which show large scatter and uncertainties. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Fractionations of carbon and oxygen isotopes and magnesium between coexisting dolomite and calcite have been determined for marbles and calcareous schists of a wide variety of metamorphic environments from Vermont and the Grenville Province of Ontario. Concordant equilibrium fractionations are given by 83 {\%} of the samples. Calibration of the isotopic thermometers using the Mg-calcite solvus thermometer gave in the temperature range: 650{\~{}}176 100{\~{}} 1,000 In eDOl-Se t = 0.45 (10{\~{}} -2) -- 0.40 1,000 1n {\~{}}DC1-{\~{}}C t = 0.18 (106T- 2) -{\{}- 0.17. These isotopic fractionation expressions differ significantly from the experimentally derived relations, including the dolomite-Mg-calcite C TM partial exchange experiments of this study. Temperature ranges obtained for the metamorphic zones of Vermont are: chlorite zone, 210 {\~{}} to 295 {\~{}} C; biotite zone, 255 {\~{}} to 400 {\~{}} C; staurolite-kyanite zone, 110 {\~{}} to 550 {\~{}} C. In amphibolite- faeies rocks the quenched partition relations can be complex. The temperature of quench or recrystallization may be as large as 400 {\~{}} C below the inferred metamorphic maximum. Oxygen isotope disequilibrium in high grade rocks, particularly from the Chester dome area, Vermont, is characterized by large negative 80 Dis -- dOcist values. The size of the equilibrium exchange system for carbon and oxygen isotopes and magnesium is small, less than a few inches across the inferred relict bedding. This is attributed to the lack of a mobile pore fluid except in systems undergoing decarbonation. C13/C12 ratios in Grenville and Vermont marbles and 01s/01{\~{}} ratios in Grenville and greenschist-facies Vermont carbonates span the range of ancient limestones. Staurolite-kyanite zone calcareous schists and marbles from the Chester dome area, Vermont are depleted in Ols({\~{}}ols:12 to 200/0o) due to equilibrium or disequilibrium decarbonation and some partial exchange. Extrapolation of the dolomite-calcite fractionation expressions to 20{\~{}} indicates that dolomite is enriched in 0 TM by about 4.90/oo and in C 13 by about 2.43/06 .}},

abstract = {An earliest Triassic methane postapocalyptic greenhouse following the Permian-Triassic (P-T) extinction event was proposed on the basis of evidence of deeply weathered paleosols at high latitudes with features of low-latitude soils, and low stomatal index values of seed fern leaves. Reexamination of distinctive phyllosilicates, unique to a single stratigraphic level, in paleosols located just above the isotopically defined Permian-Triassic boundary in Australia and Antarctica furnishes additional tests of this hypothesis. Illite is the dominant clay mineral in earliest Triassic paleosols from Antarctica, but the palleosols also contain conspicuous green nodules of coarsely crystalline berthierine. Examples from the geologic record and from experimental studies indicate that the formation of berthierine is restricted to reducing conditions. The occurrence of this unusual mineral in soils may indicate soil oxygen consumption by the influx of atmospheric methane to form carbon dioxide, which in turn warmed the earliest Triassic, giving rise to a postapocalyptic greenhouse.},

abstract = {A post-extinction calcimicrobial cap rock occurs above the giant Permian skeletal carbonate platform exposed in the western Taurus Mountains (southern Turkey). It was formed during the main step of a very rapid and large-scale platform flooding (Earliest Triassic) and has been found also in other Tethyan localities. This calcimicrobial cap rock, 20 to 40 m thick, consists of thrombolitic and stromatolitic build-ups at the base and most oolitic grainstone in the upper part. It was terminated by a sudden input of fine terrigenous sediments. The domal, columnar and conical stromatolites are ‘anachronistic' deposits as are the abundant botryoidal and fanning aragonite crystal pseudomorphs. This again shows the uniqueness of the Earliest Triassic period and indicates a delayed biotic recovery. To cite this article: A. Baud et al., C. R. Palevol 4 (2005). },

We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite upwelling onto large portions of the continental shelf, reaching depths of approximately 40 to 120 meters along most transect lines and all the way to the surface on one transect off northern California. Although seasonal upwelling of the undersaturated waters onto the shelf is a natural phenomenon in this region, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area.},

abstract = {The stable isotope geochemistry of Miocene sediments from the leeward margin of the Great Bahama Bank was examined to investigate burial diagenetic processes in periplatform carbonates. Data indicate that, in addition to differences in bulk proportions of neritic and pelagic carbonate along the slope, rhythmic variation in primary carbonate content has controlled patterns of burial diagenesis and associated geochemical signatures throughout much of the succession examined. The present study focuses on Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1006 and 1007, the most distal of five sites drilled from marginal to deep basin environments during Leg 166. These Miocene sections are characterized by their cyclic appearance, manifest as decimetre- to metre-scale alternations between light-coloured ooze/chalk/limestone and dark-coloured marl/marlstone. The section at Site 1006 contains a high proportion of pelagic carbonate and is unlithified to a subbottom depth of similar to 675 m. Fluctuations in delta O-18 and delta C-13 values at this site are independent of lithological variation and reflect primary conditions. At Site 1007, located at the toe-of-slope and composed of a mixture of bank-derived and pelagic carbonate, limestones are densely cemented, show little evidence of compaction and have delta O-18 values up to 2 parts per thousand higher than coeval sediments at Site 1006. Marlstones at Site 1007 are poorly cemented, exhibit an increase in compaction-related features with depth and have lower and more variable delta O-18 values that are similar to those of coeval sediments at Site 1006. Isotopic and petrographic characteristics of limestone interbeds result from cement precipitation from cold sea water during the first similar to 100 m of burial. Higher proportions of insoluble materials and pelagic carbonate seem to have inhibited diagenetic alteration in adjacent marlstones; in spite of significant compaction and pressure solution during burial, original isotopic compositions appear to be best preserved in these intervals at Site 1007. The documented contrasts in petrographic and isotopic patterns illustrate the role of primary sediment composition in controlling lithification processes in periplatform carbonates and stress the importance of considering such factors when interpreting geochemical data from ancient shelf and slope limestones.},

Across the world, surviving herbaceous lycopsids played a pioneering role in repopulating deforested terrain. We document that the microspores of these lycopsids were regularly released in unseparated tetrads indicative of failure to complete the normal process of spore development. Although involvement of mutation has long been hinted at or proposed in theory, this finding provides concrete evidence for chronic environmental mutagenesis at the time of global ecological crisis. Prolonged exposure to enhanced UV radiation could account satisfactorily for a worldwide increase in land plant mutation. At the end of the Permian, a period of raised UV stress may have been the consequence of severe disruption of the stratospheric ozone balance by excessive emission of hydrothermal organohalogens in the vast area of Siberian Traps volcanism.},

abstract = {The cataclysmic end-Permian mass extinction was immediately followed by a global expansion of microbial ecosystems, as demonstrated by widespread microbialite sequences (disaster facies) in shallow water settings. Here we present high-resolution carbonate carbon ($\delta$13Ccarb) and carbonate-associated sulfate–sulfur isotope ($\delta$34SCAS) records from the microbialite in the Cili Permian–Triassic (P–Tr) section in South China. A stepwise decline in $\delta$13Ccarb begins in the underlying skeletal limestone, predating the main oceanic mass extinction and the first appearance of microbialite, and reaches its nadir in the upper part of the microbialite layer. The corresponding $\delta$34SCAS, in the range of 17.4‰ to 27.4‰, is relatively stable in the underlying skeletal limestone, and increases gradually from 2{\&}{\#}xa0;m below the microbialite rising to a peak at the base of the microbialite. Two episodes of positive and negative shifts occurred within the microbialite layer, and exhibit a remarkable co-variance of sulfur and carbon isotope composition. The large amplitude of the variation in $\delta$34SCAS, as high as 7‰ per 100{\&}{\#}xa0;kiloyears, suggests a small oceanic sulfate reservoir size at this time. Furthermore, the $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$34SCAS records co-vary without phase lag throughout the microbialite interval, implying a marine-driven C cycle in an anoxic ocean with anomalously low oceanic sulfate concentrations. On the basis of a non-steady-state box model, we argue that the oceanic sulfate concentration may have fallen to less than 15{\%}, perhaps as low as 3{\%}, of that in the modern oceans. Low oceanic sulfate concentration likely was the consequence of evaporite deposition and widespread anoxic/sulfidic conditions prior to the main mass extinction.

It is superior to the evaporite-based dataset because it enables sampling of the entire biostratigraphic column. Discrete biological and environmental signals can be deciphered from a somewhat "noisy" sulfur isotope record for sedimentary biogenic pyrite. These include a maximum isotopic fractionation around -51per mille sign which appears to be constant throughout the entire Phanerozoic. Observable large spreads of delta34Ssulfide for any given sedimentary unit are caused by environmental parameters, such as type and availability of organic carbon or availability of sulfate. In particular, the growing importance of land plants and their impact on the amount of metabolizable organic substrate affects the sulfide sulfur isotopic composition.},

abstract = {The concentrations of many natural compounds are altered by chemical and biological transformations, and physical processes such as adsorption and transport. Their fate can be predicted using reactive transport models that describe reaction and advective and dispersive movement of these components in their natural environment. Recently a number of software packages have been implemented in the open source software R that allow one to implement reactive transport models. Central to this is the ReacTran R-package, a comprehensive collection of functions for modeling reactive components that may be distributed over multiple phases, whose dynamics are coupled through biological and geochemical reactions, and that are transported in one-, two- or three-dimensional domains with simple geometries. Dedicated solution methods are in R-packages deSolve and rootSolve. The modeling packages facilitate the simulation of reaction and transport of components for spatial scales ranging from micrometers to kilometers and spanning multiple time-scales. As they are influenced in similar ways, the same functions can solve biogeochemical models of the sediment, groundwater, rivers, estuaries, lakes or water columns, experimental setups, or even describe reaction and transport within flat, cylindrical or spherical bodies, such as organisms, aggregates, or the dispersion of individuals on flat surfaces and so on. We illustrate the use of R for reactive transport modeling by three applications spanning several orders of magnitude with respect to spatial and temporal scales. They comprise (1) a model of an experimental flow-through sediment reactor, where fitting so-called breakthrough curves are used to derive sulfate reduction rates in an estuarine sediment, (2) a conservative and reactive tracer addition experiment in a small stream, which implements the concept of river spiraling, and (3) a 2-D and 3-D model that describes oxygen dynamics in the upper layers of the sediment, interspersed with several hotspots of increased reaction intensities. The packages ReacTran, deSolve and rootSolve are implemented in the software R and thus available for all popular platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac). Models implemented using this software are short and easily readable, yet they are efficiently solved. This makes R extremely well suited for rapid model prototyping. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Pelagic deposits at Abadeh represent a complete biostratigraphic record across the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB). The presumed water depth during deposition of these sediments was between 60 and 90 m. Similar to other Permian/Triassic boundary sections, the succession at Abadeh is characterised by a negative carbon isotope shift of approximately 4‰. The values start to decrease in the lower C. changxingensis - C. deflecta s.l. Zone, reach −0.12‰ (V-PDB) in the uppermost Permian just below the PTB, remain low to the early I. isarcica Zone (−0.32‰) and increase subsequently in the upper I. isarcica Zone. For the time interval of the PTB negative carbon isotope excursion, between the C. iranica and the I. isarcica Zones, no correlation exists between the $\delta$ 13C carb and the $\delta$ 18O carb. The above observations argue against the conclusion of Heydari et al. (2001) that the carbon isotope event at the P/T transition is an alteration artefact and not a global signal. The decrease in $\delta$ 13C carb is accompanied by a {\~{}}5‰ (and potentially up to 10‰) increase in $\delta$ 34S SSS. Together, these features are thought to reflect a complex global event, notably the development of widespread anoxic oceans with anoxic bottom layers rising onto the shelves. For the carbon isotope drop, other factors, such as the collapse of ocean primary productivity may also have played a role. The 87Sr/ 86Sr ratios of Dzhulfian seawater show only a minor increase from 0.70705 to 0.70710, reaching 0.70720 in the Dorashamian. The increase becomes steeper in the Early Triassic reaching 0.70754 in the N. dieneri Zone. The rise of the strontium isotope values is thought to be related to enhanced continental weathering under humid climatic conditions in the uppermost Permian ( C. meishanensis - H. praeparvusZone) and the lack of a dense land vegetation in the Early Triassic, prior to the Spathian (Upper Olenekian).},

The scheme recognizes seven operationally derived iron pools: (1) carbonate associated Fe (Fecarb), including siderite and ankerite; (2) easily reducible oxides (Feox1), including ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite; (3) reducible oxides (Feox2), including goethite, hematite and akagan??ite; (4) magnetite (Femag); (5) poorly reactive sheet silicate Fe (FePRS); (6) pyrite Fe (Fepy); and (7) unreactive silicate Fe (FeU). As such, this is the first extraction scheme specifically developed to allow the separate identification of magnetite, and the first to allow a complete evaluation of Fe carbonate phases such as siderite and ankerite. The scheme was developed following tests on pure mineral phases to evaluate the minerals solubilized by each technique and to determine optimum extraction times. Further tests on mixtures of pure minerals and on grain-size separated sediments from two major US rivers and two glacial meltwaters validate the specificity of the scheme for different pools of iron minerals, and demonstrate a high degree of reproducibility for each analytical stage. The data obtained for the riverine and glacial sediments are additionally discussed in relation to the dominant modes of transport of different iron minerals in fine-grained continental sediments. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The search for early Earth biological activity is hindered by the scarcity of the rock record. The very few exposed sedimentary rocks have all been affected by secondary processes such as metamorphism and weathering, which might have distorted morphological microfossils and biogenic minerals beyond recognition and have altered organic matter to kerogen. The search for biological activity in such rocks therefore relies entirely on chemical, molecular or isotopic indicators. A powerful tool used for this purpose is the stable isotope signature of elements related to life (C, N, S, Fe). It provides key informations not only on the metabolic pathways operating at the time of the sediment deposition, but more globally on the biogeochemical cycling of these elements and thus on the Earth's surface evolution. Here, we review the basis of stable isotope biogeochemistry for these isotopic systems. Rather than an exhaustive approach, we address some examples to illustrate how they can be used as biosignatures of early life and as proxies for its environment, while keeping in mind what their limitations are. We then focus on the covariations among these isotopic systems during the Archean time period to show that they convey important information both on the evolution of the redox state of the terrestrial surface reservoirs and on co-occurring ecosystems in the Archean.},

@article{Lin2016,
abstract = {Abstract Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO4-AOM) in marine sediments commonly leads to the precipitation of pyrite. It is, however, frequently challenging to unequivocally unravel the entire history of pyritization, because of the common coexistence of SO4-AOM derived pyrite with pyrite resulting from organiclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). To better understand how SO4-AOM affects pyritization in methane-bearing sediments and how this can be identified, we applied secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze the sulfur isotope composition ($\delta$34S) of authigenic pyrite in addition to sulfur isotope measurements of bulk sulfide and hand-picked pyrite aggregates from the two seafloor sites, HS148 and HS217, in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Authigenic, mostly tubular pyrite aggregates from these sites consist of three types of pyrite: framboids, zoned aggregates with radial overgrowths surrounding a framboidal core, and euhedral pyrite crystals. Framboids with low SIMS $\delta$34S values (as low as − 41.6‰ at HS148, and − 38.8‰ at HS217) are dispersed throughout the cores, but are especially abundant in the shallow part of the sedimentary column (i.e. above 483 cmbsf in HS148; above 670 cmbsf in HS217). These patterns are interpreted to reflect the dominance of OSR during early diagenetic processes in the shallow sediments. With increasing depth, both $\delta$34S values of bulk sulfide minerals and hand-picked pyrite aggregates increase sharply at 483 cmbsf in core HS148, and at 700 cmbsf in core HS217, respectively. Radial pyrite overgrowths and euhedral crystals become abundant at depth typified by high $\delta$34S values for hand-picked pyrite. Moreover, SIMS analysis reveals an extreme variability of $\delta$34S values for the three pyrite types on a small scale in these zones. Besides some moderately 34S enriched framboids, most of the overgrowths and euhedral crystals display extremely high SIMS $\delta$34S values (as high as + 114.8‰ at HS148, and + 74.3‰ at HS217), representing the heaviest stable sulfur isotope composition of pyrite ever reported to the best of our knowledge. Such an abrupt and extreme increase in $\delta$34Spyrite values with depth is best explained by an enrichment of 34S in the pool of dissolved sulfide caused by SO4-AOM in the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The increase in $\delta$34S values from framboidal cores to overgrowth layers and euhedral crystals indicates continuous, and finally near to complete exhaustion of dissolved sulfate at the SMTZ following a Rayleigh distillation process. SO4-AOM allowed for subsequent growth of later stage pyrite over the initial framboids, part of which formed earlier and at shallower depth by OSR. The combination of a detailed petrographic study of authigenic pyrite with SIMS analysis of stable sulfur isotopes in organic-rich strata proves to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the dynamics of sulfur cycling in modern and, potentially, ancient sedimentary sequences.},

abstract = {Leg 165 of the Ocean Drilling Program afforded a unique opportunity to investigate organic and inorganic geochemistry across a wide gradient of sediment compositions and corresponding chemical pathways. The solid fractions at Site 998, 999, 1000, and 1001 reveal varying proportions of reactive carbonate species, a labile volcanic ash fraction occurring in discrete layers and as a dispersed component, and detrital fluxes that derive from continental weathering. The relative proportions and reactivities of these end-members strongly dictate the character of the diagenetic profiles observed during the pore-water work of Leg 165. In addition, alteration of the well-characterized basaltic basement at Site 1001 has provided a strong signal that is reflected in many of the dissolved components. The relative effects of basement alteration and diagenesis within the sediment column are discussed in terms of downcore relationships for dissolved calcium and magnesium. With the exception of Site 1002 in the Cariaco Basin, the sediments encountered during Leg 165 were uniformly deficient in organic carbon (typically {\textless}0.1 wt{\%}). Consequently, rates of organic oxidation were generally low and dominated by suboxic pathways with subordinate levels of bacterial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The low rates of organic remineralization are supported by modeled rates of sulfate reduction. Site 1000 provided an exception to the generally low levels of microbially mediated redox cycling. At this site the sediment is slightly more enriched in organic phases, and externally derived thermogenic hydrocarbons appear to aid in driving enhanced levels of redox diagenesis at great depths below the seafloor. The entrapment of these volatiles corresponds with a permeability seal defined by a pronounced Miocene minimum in calcium carbonate concentration recognized throughout the basin and with a dramatic downcore increase in the magnitude of limestone lithification. The latter has been tentatively linked to increases in alkalinity associated with microbial oxidation of organic matter and gaseous hydrocarbons. Recognition and quantification of previously unconstrained large volumes and frequencies of Eocene and Miocene silicic volcanic ash within the Caribbean Basin is one of the major findings of Leg 165. High frequencies of volcanic ash layers manifest as varied but often dominant controls on pore-water chemistry. Sulfur isotope results are presented that speak to secondary metal and sulfur enrichments observed in ash layers sampled during Leg 165. Ultimately, a better mechanistic understanding of these processes and the extent to which they have varied spatially and temporally may bear on the global mass balances for a range of major and minor dissolved components of seawater.},

Previous ion microprobe conodont $\delta$18O studies have proceeded directly to palaeotempera- ture interpretation without appreciation of inter- and intra-element variability or post-mortem artefacts. Here, ion microprobe analyses of Ordovician and Silurian conodonts establishes that: intra-element crown tissue $\delta$18O typically varies by ≤1‰ (53{\%} of conodonts analysed), is normally ≤2‰ (92{\%} of analyses), and rarely varies by 2–4‰; $\delta$18O can vary across elements, suggesting a microstructural and/or diagenetic control; $\delta$18O can vary between species representatives by c. 3‰; $\delta$18O of pelagic and nektobenthic taxa can be offset by 2–3‰; elements processed with formic acid have highly variable $\delta$18O; and thermal alteration does affect $\delta$18O. Conodont ion microprobe $\delta$18O values are comparable with those of bulk methods, but utilization of material with no consideration of geological context or processing history may introduce significant artefacts.

abstract = {Periods of oceanic anoxia have had a major influence on the evolutionary history of Earth and are often contemporaneous with mass extinction events. Changes in global (as opposed to local) redox conditions can be potentially evaluated using U system proxies. The intensity and timing of oceanic redox changes associated with the end-Permian extinction horizon (EH) were assessed from variations in (238)U/(235)U ($\delta$(238)U) and Th/U ratios in a carbonate section at Dawen in southern China. The EH is characterized by shifts toward lower $\delta$(238)U values (from -0.37‰ to -0.65‰), indicative of an expansion of oceanic anoxia, and higher Th/U ratios (from 0.06 to 0.42), indicative of drawdown of U concentrations in seawater. Using a mass balance model, we estimate that this isotopic shift represents a sixfold increase in the flux of U to anoxic facies, implying a corresponding increase in the extent of oceanic anoxia. The intensification of oceanic anoxia coincided with, or slightly preceded, the EH and persisted for an interval of at least 40,000 to 50,000 y following the EH. These findings challenge previous hypotheses of an extended period of whole-ocean anoxia prior to the end-Permian extinction.},

abstract = {Two Permian/Triassic boundary sections in central Japan provide a rare window into environmental conditions within the Panthalassic Ocean, which encompassed more than half the Earth's surface at 252. Ma. Integration of petrographic, geochemical, and time series data provides new insights regarding the fluxes of major and trace components to the sediment as well as environmental conditions in both the deep and intermediate water masses at each study site. The Ubara section was located in a high-productivity peri-equatorial location, whereas the Gujo-Hachiman section was located in a moderate-productivity location at some distance from the paleoequator. An upward transition from gray organic-poor cherts to black siliceous mudstones at both sites occurred in conjunction with increased primary productivity, intensified euxinia within the oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ), and decimation of the radiolarian zooplankton community. Euxinia in the OMZ of the equatorial Panthalassic Ocean developed episodically for a {\~{}}. 200-250. kyr interval during the Late Permian, followed by an abrupt intensification and lateral expansion of the OMZ around the Permian-Triassic boundary. Throughout the study interval, bottom waters at both sites remained mostly suboxic, a finding that counters hypotheses of development of a "superanoxic" Permo-Triassic deep ocean as a consequence of stagnation of oceanic overturning circulation. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sedimentary molybdenum, [Mo]s, has been widely used as a proxy for benthic redox potential owing to its generally strong enrichment in organic-rich marine facies deposited under oxygen-depleted conditions. A detailed analysis of [Mo]s{\&}{\#}8211;total organic carbon (TOC) covariation in modern anoxic marine environments and its relationship to ambient water chemistry suggests that (1) [Mo]s, while useful in distinguishing oxic from anoxic facies, is not related in a simple manner to dissolved sulfide concentrations within euxinic environments and (2) patterns of [Mo]s-TOC covariation can provide information about paleohydrographic conditions, especially the degree of restriction of the subchemoclinal water mass and temporal changes thereof related to deepwater renewal. These inferences are based on data from four anoxic silled basins (the Black Sea, Framvaren Fjord, Cariaco Basin, and Saanich Inlet) and one upwelling zone (the Namibian Shelf), representing a spectrum of aqueous chemical conditions related to water mass restriction. In the silled-basin environments, increasing restriction is correlated with a systematic decrease in [Mo]s/TOC ratios, from {\&}{\#}8764;45 ± 5 for Saanich Inlet to {\&}{\#}8764;4.5 ± 1 for the Black Sea. This variation reflects control of [Mo]s by [Mo]aq, which becomes depleted in stagnant basins through removal to the sediment without adequate resupply by deepwater renewal (the {\&}{\#}8220;basin reservoir effect{\&}{\#}8221;). The temporal dynamics of this process are revealed by high-resolution chemostratigraphic data from Framvaren Fjord and Cariaco Basin sediment cores, which exhibit long-term trends toward lower [Mo]s/TOC ratios following development of water column stratification and deepwater anoxia. Mo burial fluxes peak in weakly sulfidic environments such as Saanich Inlet (owing to a combination of greater [Mo]aq availability and enhanced Mo transport to the sediment-water interface via Fe-Mn redox cycling) and are lower in strongly sulfidic environments such as the Black Sea and Framvaren Fjord. These observations demonstrate that, at timescales associated with deepwater renewal in anoxic silled basins, decreased sedimentary Mo concentrations and burial fluxes are associated with lower benthic redox potentials (i.e., more sulfidic conditions). These conclusions apply only to anoxic marine environments exhibiting some degree of water mass restriction (e.g., silled basins) and are not valid for low-oxygen facies in open marine settings such as continent-margin upwelling systems.},

abstract = {A diagenetic reaction-transport model was used to simulate how the sediment redox boundary migrates in response to persistent or episodic changes in the deposition flux of degradable organic matter and the concentration of oxygen in the overlying bottom water. The position of the redox boundary is represented by the depth of oxygen penetration. The simulations reveal that the position of the redox boundary in organic-poor sediments, such as those in the deep basins of the Arctic Ocean, is highly sensitive to the flux of organic matter: relatively small and/or brief increases in that flux can cause the redox boundary to migrate rapidly from deep within the sediment to within a few centimeters of the sediment–water interface. Reoxidation of the sediment column after such an event can take years. Redox fluctuations can redistribute solid-phase manganese within the sediment column and produce multiple concentration peaks in its depth profile on a decadal time scale. Manganese peaks observed in sediment cores from the deep basins of the Arctic Ocean do not necessarily correspond to the position of the redox boundary during previous climatic periods or reflect historical changes in manganese deposition rates. The model supports the hypothesis that the recent decrease in the Arctic ice cover has increased the flux of organic matter to the seafloor and moved the redox boundary close to the sediment–water interface. The presence of iron sulfides at depths significantly below the bioturbated layer suggests that either the Arctic sediments have been anoxic for millennia, or iron and sulfate are reduced at these depths by dissolved organic matter diffusing downward from the bioturbation zone.},

Modern stroma- tolites, however, provide analogs to only a small subset of the structures preserved in Archean and Proterozoic carbonates. Thus, interpretations of secular trends in the shapes and textures of ancient columnar stromatolites require nonuniformitarian, scale-dependent models of microbial responses to nutrient availability, seawater chemistry, influx of sediment grains, shear, and burial. Models that integrate stromatolite scales,macroscopic organiza- tion, and shapes could also help test the biogenicity of the oldest stromato- lites and other structures whose petrographic fabrics do not preserve direct evidence of microbial activity. An improved understanding of stromatolite morphogenesis in the presence of oxygenic and anoxygenic microbial mats may illuminate the diversity of microbial metabolisms that contributed to stromatolite growth in early oceans.},

abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO(2) (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

abstract = {The Carboniferous-Permian Dwyka Group in southern Namibia is subdivided into four upward-fining deglaciation sequences, each of which is capped by fine-grained glaciolacustrine or glaciomarine deposits. Both the second and the third deglaciation sequences are associated with mudstone units that are particularly widespread—the Ganigobis Shale Member and the Hardap Shale Member. An abundance of marine macrofossils and ichnofossils and extrabasinally derived fallout tuff horizons characterize these mudstones and provide the basis for an integrated high-resolution biostratigraphic and tephrostratigraphic framework.Juvenile magmatic zircons separated from tuff horizons at the base of the Ganigobis Shale Member (top deglaciation sequence II) yield 206Pb/238U sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) ages of 302.3 ± 2.1, 302.0 ± 3.0 Ma, and 299.5 ± 3.1 Ma, whereas a tuff associated with the upper part of the Hardap Shale Member (top deglaciation sequence III) reveals a SHRIMP age of 297.1 ± 1.8 Ma. Since macrofaunal occurrences reveal the Hardap Shale Member to be a correlative of the Gondwana-wide Eurydesma transgression, this datum is an important age calibration for a well-established global event. Tuff beds sampled next to the boundary between the glacial Dwyka Group and the postglacial Ecca Group yield SHRIMP ages of 290.9 ± 1.7 Ma and 288.5 ± 1.6 Ma, providing an age proxy for the end of the late Paleozoic ice age in southern Africa.},

Given reasonable assumptions about the isotopic composition of Cretaceous seawater, our results suggest that middle bathyal water temperatures at Blake Nose increased from similar to12 degreesC in the late Albian through middle Cenomanian to a maximum of 20 degreesC during the latest Cenomanian and earliest Turonian. Bottom waters were again similar to12 degreesC during the middle Campanian and cooled to a minimum of 9 T during the Maastrichtian. Correlative middle bathyal foraminifera from other ocean basins yield paleotemperature estimates that are very similar to those from Blake Nose. Comparison of global bottom-water temperatures and latitudinal thermal gradients suggests that global climate changed from a warm greenhouse state during the late Albian through late Cenomanian to a hot greenhouse phase during the latest Cenomanian through early Campanian, then to cool greenhouse conditions during the mid-Campanian through Maastrichtian.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction greatly affected the sedimentary record, but the sedimentary response was not limited to the Permian–Triassic boundary interval. This transformation extended to sedimentation that spanned the entire Early Triassic. Calcimicrobialites play an important role throughout this time interval, and at least four main events of anomalous carbonate deposition can be shown. A post-extinction calcimicrobial unit occurs above the extensive Permian skeletal carbonate platform exposed in the Taurus Mountains (southern Turkey), in south Armenia, north-west north and Central Iran along the Zagros Mountains. The calcimicrobial unit formed during the flooding of the platform that took place during the earliest Triassic. A similar calcimicrobialite formed during late Griesbachian to Dienerian time atop the shallow Permian skeletal carbonate platform largely exposed in south China. A third event occurred during the Early Olenekian on the first Mesozoic isolated pelagic plateau (Baid seamount, Oman Mountains). Here the change in carbonate sedimentation is reflected in the occurrence of thrombolites and carbonate seafloor fans. Near the end of Early Triassic time, unusual carbonate deposition is recorded both on an isolated pelagic plateau of the Western Tethys (Halstatt limestone of Dobrogea, Romania) and on the eastern Panthalassa margin of the western United States. In the western United States, the event is represented by stromatolites and thrombolites in the Virgin Limestone of the Moenkopi Formation and by seafloor fans in the middle and upper members of the Union Wash Formation. These unusual episodes of anomalous carbonate deposition illustrate a fundamental change in sedimentation that occurred in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction.},

abstract = {The largest extinction of the Phanerozoic occurred near the Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary some 252 Ma ago. Several scenarios and drivers have been proposed for this event. Here we report for the first time an integrated study comprising sedimentological data, biomarker distributions/abundances and selected stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes along with bulk isotopes ([delta]34Spyrite, [delta]13Ccarb, [delta]13Corg) for a Late Permian section from Lusitaniadalen, Spitsbergen, Norway. Sedimentological and geochemical data support a marine transgression and collapse of the marine ecosystem in the Late Permian. Strong evidence for waxing and waning of photic zone euxinia throughout the Late Permian is provided by Chlorobiaceae-derived biomarkers (including [delta]13C data) and [delta]34Spyrite, implying multiple phases of H2S outgassing and potentially several pulses of extinction. A rapid decrease in abundance of various land-plant biomarkers prior to the marine collapse event indicates a dramatic decline of land-plants during the Late Permian and/or increasing distance from palaeoshoreline as a consequence of sea level rise. Changes in [delta]D of selected biomarkers also suggest a change in source of organic matter (OM) or sea level rise. We also found biomarker and isotopic evidence for a phytoplanktonic bloom triggered by eutrophication as a consequence of the marine collapse. Compound specific isotope analyses (CSIA) of algal and land-plant-derived biomarkers, as well as [delta]13C of carbonate and bulk OM provide strong evidence for synchronous changes in [delta]13C of marine and atmospheric CO2, attributed to a 13C-depleted source. The source could be associated with isotopically depleted methane released from the melting of gas clathrates and/or from respired OM, due to collapse of the marine ecosystem.},

abstract = {We describe variations in trace element compositions that occurred on the deep seafloor of palaeo-superocean Panthalassa during the end-Permian mass extinction based on samples of sedimentary rock from one of the most continuous Permian-Triassic boundary sections of the pelagic deep sea exposed in north-eastern Japan. Our measurements revealed low manganese (Mn) enrichment factor (normalised by the composition of the average upper continental crust) and high cerium anomaly values throughout the section, suggesting that a reducing condition already existed in the depositional environment in the Changhsingian (Late Permian). Other redox-sensitive trace-element (vanadium [V], chromium [Cr], molybdenum [Mo], and uranium [U]) enrichment factors provide a detailed redox history ranging from the upper Permian to the end of the Permian. A single V increase (representing the first reduction state of a two-step V reduction process) detected in uppermost Changhsingian chert beds suggests development into a mildly reducing deep-sea condition less than 1 million years before the end-Permian mass extinction. Subsequently, a more reducing condition, inferred from increases in Cr, V, and Mo, developed in overlying Changhsingian grey siliceous claystone beds. The most reducing sulphidic condition is recognised by the highest peaks of Mo and V (second reduction state) in the uppermost siliceous claystone and overlying lowermost black claystone beds, in accordance with the end-Permian mass extinction event. This significant increase in Mo in the upper Changhsingian led to a high Mo/U ratio, much larger than that of modern sulphidic ocean regions. This trend suggests that sulphidic water conditions developed both at the sediment-water interface and in the water column. Above the end-Permian mass extinction horizon, Mo, V and Cr decrease significantly. On this trend, we provide an interpretation of drawdown of these elements in seawater after the massive element precipitation event during the end-Permian maximum development of the reducing water column. A decrease in the Mo/U ratio despite enrichment of Mo and U also supports that of Mo. Calculations of the total amounts of these elements precipitated compared with the global seawater inventory suggest that when more than 6-10{\%} of the global ocean became euxinic as much as the study section, most of the dissolved elements would precipitate into sediments, resulting in a global element-depleted seawater condition. Mo, V, and Cr act as bioessential elements for both primary producers and animals. The continuing reducing water column and the lack of bioessential elements could have had a considerable effect on primary producer turnover and marine life metabolism not only in the pelagic environment, but also in surrounding marine environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A distinct negative ??13C excursion is documented in two Permian-Triassic sections (Heping and Taiping) in shallow marine carbonate platform deposits in the Nanpanjiang Basin, south China. These sections span from the Changhsingian to the Dienerian and are characterized by a distinct marine boundary facies change from massive, skeletal lime packstone in the Changhsingian to distinctive calcimicrobial framestone in the Griesbachian Hindeodus parvus Zone. The ??13Corg and ?? 13Ccarb excursions occur directly after the onset of the calcimicrobial framestone (herein termed the 'Permian-Triassic boundary event') and before the first occurrence of H. parvus. The isotope shifts are associated with a sharp drop in species abundance and diversity and coincide with a decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) content. The shift towards depleted values in ??13Corg and ??13C carb at the Permian-Triassic boundary event, together with low TOC contents, persists throughout the Griesbachian H. parvus Zone. These data document a corresponding negative shift of ??13Corg and ??13Ccarb, values and low TOC contents with the onset of growth of calcified microbial framestones (a postextinction 'disaster facies') immediately below the base of the Griesbachian H. parvus Zone. Based on paleontological evidence, the first occurrence of the 'disaster facies' follows the extinction event, which implies that the 13C-depleted values above this facies postdate the event. This suggests that two separate events had to account for the initiation of the extinction and the ?? 13C excursion. However, the consequences that led to the negative isotopic shift might be linked to the intriguing recovery lag of Early Triassic ecosystems. Based on data from PTB sections worldwide of a greater ?? 13C offset in high compared with low latitudes, we propose that methane eruptions from thermal destabilization of high-latitude clathrate deposits may have led to the negative ??13C shift and may have caused long-term adverse ecological conditions. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

For the first time, it allows an exact correlation of the PTB in all marine facies and faunal realms. The following features of the extinction and recovery patterns near the PTB are most important for the search for causes of the PTB biotic crisis: (1) most strongly affected were the (siliceous) plankton (radiolarians) and the warm-water benthos and nekton; (2) most of the cold-water faunas were not significantly affected; (3) the recovery of the warm-water benthos and siliceous plankton occurred only after an unusually long time (during the late Olenekian and Middle Triassic); (4) the productivity of the terrestrial plants dropped strongly and the recovery was mainly in the upper Olenekian and in the Middle Triassic; (5) several terrestrial extinction events occurred at different levels within the Upper Permian, considerable before the marine PTB; at or close to the FAD of Lystrosaurus no extinction event in the terrestrial faunas can be observed; (6) terrestrial faunal elements that survived the Dzhulfian-Dorashamian extinctions were able to survive some months of extreme climatic conditions by hibernation-like life stages (vertebrates), or by dry- and freezing-resistant eggs (conchostracans); (7) about 50{\%} of the genera that disappeared at the PTB re-appeared in the Olenekian-Middle Triassic interval (Lazarus taxa), or in this time interval genera appeared that had undoubtedly evolved from genera that had disappeared at the PTB; and (8) the PTB is preceded by mass occurrences of marine (and continental?) fungi, and the fungal spike ends abruptly a little before the PTB. A scenario for the PTB biotic crisis is elaborated that takes into consideration: the real (not interpolated) diversity patterns of different marine and continental fossil groups, the exact correlation of bioevents in different faunal realms and facies, the strong biotic crisis in the Tethyan warm-water faunas in contrast to the much weaker biotic event in cold-water faunas, the severe Dzhulfian-Dorashamian climate in many parts of the world caused by the continent-ocean configuration and by Siberian Trap volcanism, the cooling of the Boreal area by the northward drift of Pangaea that interrupted the exchange of warm-water benthos between the Tethys and western North America during the Guadalupian, the extinction event at the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary that restricted most of the affected warm-water faunas to the Tethys, the importance of lower Scythian anoxia that reached an unusually shallow level, and above all the effects of the contemporaneous huge volcanic events about 250 m.y. ago on the Siberian Platform and in the eastern Tethys that caused a 3-6-months-lasting volcanic winter with strong cooling in low latitudes, followed by a strong global warming.},

These data, in conjunction with data from the literature, provide insights on the drift history of Iran as part of Cimmeria during the Ordovician–Triassic. A robust agreement of palaeomagnetic poles of Iran and West Gondwana is observed for the Late Ordovician–earliest Carboniferous, indicating that Iran was part of Gondwana during that time. Data for the Late Permian–early Early Triassic indicate that Iran resided on subequatorial palaeolatitudes, clearly disengaged from the parental Gondwanan margin in the southern hemisphere. Since the late Early Triassic, Iran has been located in the northern hemisphere close to the Eurasian margin. This northward drift brought Iran to cover much of the Palaeotethys in approximately 35 Ma, at an average plate speed of c. 7–8 cm year−1, and was in part coeval to the transformation of Pangaea from an Irvingian B to a Wegenerian A-type configuration.},

abstract = {A new Early Triassic marine fauna is described from the Central Oman Mountains. The fauna is Griesbachian in age, on the basis of abundant conodonts and ammonoids, and was deposited in an oxygenated seamount setting off the Arabian platform margin. It is the first Griesbachian assemblage from a well-oxygenated marine setting and thus provides a test for the hypothesis that widespread anoxia prevented rapid recovery. The earliest Griesbachian (parvus zone) contains a low-diversity benthic fauna dominated by the bivalves Promyalina and Claraia. A similar level of recovery characterizes the immediate postextinction interval worldwide. However, the middle upper Griesbachian sedimentary rocks (isarcica and carinata zones) contain an incredibly diverse benthic fauna of bivalves, gastropods, articulate brachiopods, a new undescribed crinoid, echinoids, and ostracods. This fauna is more diverse and ecologically complex than the typical middle to late Griesbachian faunas described from oxygen-restricted settings worldwide. The level of postextinction recovery observed in the Oman fauna is not recorded elsewhere until the Spathian. These data support the hypothesis that the apparent delay in recovery after the end-Permian extinction event was due to widespread and prolonged benthic oxygen restriction: in the absence of anoxia, marine recovery is much faster.},

abstract = {Quantitative tools for deciphering the environment of microbialite formation are relatively limited. For example, the oxygen isotope carbonate-water geothermometer requires assumptions about the isotopic composition of the water of formation. We explored the utility of using 'clumped' isotope thermometry as a tool to study the temperatures of microbialite formation. We studied microbialites recovered from water depths of 10-55 m in Pavilion Lake, and 10-25 m in Kelly Lake, spanning the thermocline in both lakes. We determined the temperature of carbonate growth and the (18) O/(16) O ratio of the waters that microbialites grew in. Results were then compared to current limnological data from the lakes to reconstruct the history of microbialite formation. Modern microbialites collected at shallow depths (11.7 m) in both lakes yield clumped isotope-based temperatures of formation that are within error of summer water temperatures, suggesting that clumped isotope analyses may be used to reconstruct past climates and to probe the environments in which microbialites formed. The deepest microbialites (21.7-55 m) were recovered from below the present-day thermoclines in both lakes and yield radioisotope ages indicating they primarily formed earlier in the Holocene. During this time, pollen data and our reconstructed water (18) O/(16) O ratios indicate a period of aridity, with lower lake levels. At present, there is a close association between both photosynthetic and heterotrophic communities, and carbonate precipitation/microbialite formation, with biosignatures of photosynthetic influences on carbonate detected in microbialites from the photic zone and above the thermocline (i.e., depths of generally {\textless}20 m). Given the deeper microbialites are receiving {\textless}1{\%} of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it is likely these microbialites primarily formed when lower lake levels resulted in microbialites being located higher in the photic zone, in warm surface waters.},

abstract = {The Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a significant global warming event in the Earth's history (approx. 55 Ma). The cause for this warming event has been linked to increases in greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide and methane. This rapid warming took place in the presence of the existing Early Eocene warm climate. Given that projected business-as-usual levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide reach concentrations of 800–1100 ppmv by 2100, it is of interest to study past climates where atmospheric carbon dioxide was higher than present. This is especially the case given the difficulty of climate models in simulating past warm climates. This study explores the sensitivity of the simulated pre-PETM and PETM periods to change in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and microphysical properties of liquid water clouds. Assuming lower levels of CCN for both of these periods leads to significant warming, especially at high latitudes. The study indicates that past differences in cloud properties may be an important factor in accurately simulating past warm climates. Importantly, additional shortwave warming from such a mechanism would imply lower required atmospheric CO2 concentrations for simulated surface temperatures to be in reasonable agreement with proxy data for the Eocene.},

abstract = {Large conodont samples have been collected from the uppermost Permian and lowermost Triassic (beds 24–29) at the Meishan section — the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Permian–Triassic Boundary. This new information revises the ranges of some important conodont species in this section. For the first time, usable numbers of Neogondolella specimens have been found from the basal-most Triassic, enabling the establishment of parallel hindeodid and gondolellid zonations through the same section over this interval. In ascending order, the refined hindeodid zones are as follows: Hindeodus latidentatus Zone (bed 24a), Hindeodus praeparvus Zone (24b–26), Hindeodus changxingensis Zone (27a–b), Hindeodus parvus Zone (27c), Isarcicella staeschei Zone (27d–28), Isarcicella isarcica Zone (bed 29 and above). Three revised and newly established Neogondolella zones are proposed. In ascending order these are as follows: Neogondolella yini Zone (bed 24 and below), Neogondolella meishanensis Zone (25–26), Neogondolella taylorae Zone (27a and above). Neogondolella taylorae—a proposed earliest Triassic marker species, first appears in bed 27a, just below specimens of Hindeodus cf. parvus in bed 27b. Three successive conodont faunal assemblages are identified through the Permian–Triassic transitional interval.},

abstract = {This paper documents a new Permian-Triassic carbonate sequence which recorded the end-Permian mass extinction in the isolated oceanic setting of Neotethys in southwestern Tibet, China. The sequence is over 350m thick and consists of the Gyanyima and the Lower Lanchengquxia formations in ascending order. The Lopingian (Late Permian) Gyanyima Formation is composed of fossiliferous reddish carbonates dominated by Colaniella grainstone and reef facies including fenestrate/sponge/coral framestone and bafflestone. 156 species are recognized from the Lopingian Gyanyima Formation. Composite ranges of brachiopods, ostracods, rugose corals and foraminifers at the Gyanyima Section suggest that evolution and diversification of Permian marine organisms continued to the end-Permian preceding a major faunal extinction close to the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB), coincident with a 2-3??? negative shift of ??13Ccarb. The timing and accelerating extinction pattern and the negative ??13Ccarb excursion are largely comparable with those reported from many previously-documented sections on continental shelf environments.Based on a detailed lithofacies analysis, the latest Permian reefal facies is sharply replaced by ostracod/crinoid packstone/grainstone with abrupt abundant occurrences of Early Triassic conodonts at the Gyanyima Section. This is then followed by thrombolitic microbialite, stromatolite, packstone containing abundant spherical microbes, and bivalve/ammonoid packstone of tidal and intertidal facies. This distinct lithofacies and biofacies shift would, therefore, suggest a dramatic faunal community and environmental change across the PTB. Distinct palaeoclimate fluctuations through the P-T interval are also indicated by the alternation of warm- and cool-water faunas through the uppermost part of the succession. The lower part of the Gyanyima Formation is characterized by a warm condition as indicated by Cathaysian-dominated fossils. This was then followed by a mild cooling event as suggested by the occurrence of many distinct peri-Gondwanan elements and absence of compound corals. The latest Changhsingian is characterized exclusively by warm-water faunal elements of Cathaysian affinities, together with the negative shift of ??13Ccarb, suggesting a rapid warming event at the very end of Permian in association with much more widespread volcanic activities than we thought before. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {STROMATOLITES are laminated, accretionary structures, which are commonly regarded to have formed by the sediment-binding or precipitating activities of ancient microbial mats or biofilms (composed mainly of cyanobacteria), possibly supplemented by abiotic surface precipitation. Stromatolites are thus considered to be a proxy for early life on Earth, as the record of these structures extends back to 3.5 Gyr ago But as stromatolites only rarely contain fossil microbes, their biogenicity is tacitly assumed on the basis of morphological comparisons with modern, demonstrably biological, structures Little is known about the physical, chemical and biological processes that controlled the growth of ancient stromatolites4 and, with pioneering exceptions7-9, the analysis of the inherent geometric characteristics of the structures has not been pursued. Here we present a morphological characterization of ancient stromatolites that have growth surfaces with self-affine fractal geometry. We deduce, from both the microscopic textures and the fractal dimension, a purely abiotic dynamical model of stromatolite surface growth that combines chemical precipitation on the growing interface, fallout and diffusive rearrangement of suspended sediment, and uncorrelated random noise. This result calls into question the assumption that organisms-even if present-necessarily played an essential role in determining stromatolite morphology during times when precipitation at the sea floor was common, such as the earlier Precambrian.},

abstract = {Detailed sampling and analysis of Jurassic pelagic limestones and marls from Italy, Hungary and Switzerland have enabled construction of an isotope stratigraphy across the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary with resolution to the zonal level. The oxygen-isotope record is unremarkable. The carbon isotopes, however, show two positive excursions: one, relatively minor, during the Pliensbachian, margaritatus Zone, subnodosus Subzone, the other, more Major, during the Toarcian, early falciferum Zone, where a maximum $\delta$[SUP13]C value of 4.52{\%}[SUB0PDB] is attained. These intervals are known to be favoured periods of organic-rich sedimentation in diverse parts of the globe and the isotopic excursions are interpreted as a response to abnormally high rates of storage of organic carbon in the sedimentary record. A comparable phenomenon has been documented from the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary in the Cretaceous where it has been referred to the influence of an 'Oceanic Anoxic Event'. Some Italian sections spanning this Lower Jurassic interval contain organic-rich shales in the falciferum Zone; the isotopic signatures from their included, locally manganiferous carbonate betray a considerable Zone; the isotopic signatures from their included, locally manganiferous carbonate betray a considerable diagenetic overprint and they cannot therefore be incorporated in a composite isotopic curve. Carbon isotopes from the organic carbon itself are extremely negative, falling to -33{\%}[SUB0PDB] and, in one section examined in detail, correlate with the calcium-carbonate content of the shales; they may reflect a partial change to a non-calcified planktonic biota during deposition of this lime-poor interval, possibly responding to upwelling and increased fertility of near-surface water. The onset of upwelling may have been as early as spinatum-tenuicostatum Zone time, that is, at the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary.

abstract = {Triassic and Jurassic floral lists from Eurasia have been subjected to an ordination study. A latitudinal gradient is revealed for each interval of each epoch which can be interpreted climatically as ranging through the dry subtropical to the warm and cool temperate biomes. Floras at the dry end of the spectrum may be identified by the dominance of microphyllous conifers and the regional association with evaporites. At the other extreme, the cool temperate floras are recognized by the abundance of deciduous ginkgophytes and broadleaved conifers. The highest diversity, centered at about 40 degrees palaeolatitude, occurs in the intermediate warm temperate zone which may contain all of the above floral elements in association with numerous fern and cycad genera. The transitions between these biomes remained at relatively constant latitudes, from the late Triassic to the early Cretaceous, suggesting climate stasis over a long interval. Climate changes, perceived locally, appear to be the result of continental motion rather than true global change. During the early and middle Triassic, however, the biomes are less distinct, with floras interpreted as warm temperate extending to latitudes of up to 70 degrees north.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction was the most severe loss of marine and terrestrial biota in the last 542 My. Understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics depends on an accurate and precise age model. U-Pb zircon dates for five volcanic ash beds from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Permian-Triassic boundary at Meishan, China, define an age model for the extinction and allow exploration of the links between global environmental perturbation, carbon cycle disruption, mass extinction, and recovery at millennial timescales. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion, and establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. },

A large compilation of Ca isotope ratios for modern carbonates, incorporating more than 50 new measurements, represents the quantitatively important components of the system. With this data set, distinct Ca isotope ratios are identified for different types of marine carbonate, the balance of which has changed over time with shifts between calcite and aragonite seas and with the development of pelagic calcification during the Mesozoic. It is suggested that large-scale changes in the Ca isotope ratio of seawater, as exemplified by that in the Carboniferous, were no longer possible after Jurassic time because of the generation of a deep-sea calcite sink expressed by deposition of foraminiferal–coccolith ooze across the world ocean. This work demonstrates the close connection between isotopic cycling, carbonate sedimentation, seawater chemistry, and evolutionary trends.},

abstract = {Carbon isotopic studies from marine organic matter of the Permian-Triassic Maitai Group, New Zealand, reveal a significant 513Corg shift toward more negative values within the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. These isotopic data chemostratigraphically define the previously debated position of the Permian-Triassic boundary in the Maitai Group. The Permian-Triassic record of the Maitai Group is also important because of its high paleolatitudinal setting and the deposition at intermediate depths in the ocean (c. 400 m) within a volcanic arc-related basin. Marine Permian-Triassic strata deposited at water depths deeper than shelf areas are rare. High latitude Permian-Triassic boundary sections document a significantly larger isotopic offset across the boundary compared with lower latitude settings. Carbon isotopic values decrease rapidly by an average of 7{\%}o from homogeneous values (x -25{\%}o) in the Tramway and lower Little Ben Sandstone Formation to highly lluctuating and very depleted values (x -32{\%}o) within the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. The lowermost Big Ben and Tramway Formations are considered to be Permian in age, based on their homogeneous and comparably heavier carbon isotopic values and supported by fossil atomodesmatinid bivalves. Based on the distinct 513Corg excursion toward negative values and the concurrent onset of strong isotopic fluctuations, the Permian-Triassic boundary is placed in the lower half of the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. Very depleted 813C values in the Little Ben Sandstone Formation of-38{\%}o indicate a contribution from isotopically light methane. A possible methane source is clathrates, released by large submarine slides or warming-induced melting of permafrost. The Little Ben Sandstone Formation has been interpreted as a massive event deposit from a submarine slide (Landis 1980). This hypothesised methane release could have been in part responsible for the larger Permian-Triassic isotopic shift in high latitudes compared with low latitudes because large volumes of clathrates are trapped in continental shelves and high-latitude permafrost.},

abstract = {We determined 15N/14N ratios in modern surface and sapropel S5 sediments of the Mediterranean Sea to clarify differences in the nutrient regime associated with sapropel formation. In the modern situation, high [delta]15N of unused nitrate (15-20 [per mille sign]) remaining in the surface waters during the winter phytoplankton bloom evidences P-limitation of biological production in winter. [delta]15N of surface sediments decrease towards the east of the basin (5 to {\textgreater}2.5[per mille sign]). This is a consequence of either eastward increasing nitrogen fixation during the summer months, or of particulate matter being supplied predominantly by the P-limited winter bloom. Very low (-1-1[per mille sign]) [delta]15N values in sapropel S-5 from four locations require a very light source of nutrient-N assimilated at a minimum of ten times the modern export flux. Because the isochronous records show no spatial gradient in [delta]15N, we exclude both Ekman-type upwelling and direct riverine discharge as likely sources of nutrients. Our data are consistent with an anti-estuarine thermohaline circulation in the upper 500m during S5 time, allowing for the trapping of nutrients in the eastern basin. The most likely scenario for S5 is that phosphorus release from a relatively shallow redox boundary resulted in an imbalanced supply of N:P ({\textless}16:1) to the photic zone. The result was a slow assimilation of carbon during summer stratification and extensive N2-fixation providing the majority of the export flux from a N-limited system.},

abstract = {Phanerozoic levels of atmospheric oxygen relate to the burial histories of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur. The sulfur cycle remains poorly constrained, however, leading to concomitant uncertainties in O2 budgets. Here we present experiments linking the magnitude of fractionations of the multiple sulfur isotopes to the rate of microbial sulfate reduction. The data demonstrate that such fractionations are controlled by the availability of electron donor (organic matter), rather than by the concentration of electron acceptor (sulfate), an environmental constraint that varies among sedimentary burial environments. By coupling these results with a sediment biogeochemical model of pyrite burial, we find a strong relationship between observed sulfur isotope fractionations over the last 200 Ma and the areal extent of shallow seafloor environments. We interpret this as a global dependency of the rate of microbial sulfate reduction on the availability of organic-rich sea-floor settings. However, fractionation during the early/mid-Paleozoic fails to correlate with shelf area. We suggest that this decoupling reflects a shallower paleoredox boundary, primarily confined to the water column in the early Phanerozoic. The transition between these two states begins during the Carboniferous and concludes approximately around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, indicating a prolonged response to a Carboniferous rise in O2. Together, these results lay the foundation for decoupling changes in sulfate reduction rates from the global average record of pyrite burial, highlighting how the local nature of sedimentary processes affects global records. This distinction greatly refines our understanding of the S cycle and its relationship to the history of atmospheric oxygen.},

abstract = {The smoking gun revealing the secrets of the end-Permian mass mortality is a unique 1-2-m-thick layer consisting of 5-20-cm-long crystals of calcite that occurs precisely at the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) in Iran, Armenia, Turkey, and China. This layer is interpreted as synsedimentary, abiotic, seafloor cement indicative of precipitation from a highly carbonate supersaturated seawater. Its delta(13)C Composition (delta(13)C=0 parts per thousand PDB) is 4 parts per thousand to 5 parts per thousand PDB lower than the typical Upper Permian values (4 parts per thousand to 5 parts per thousand PDB), suggesting the involvement of massive amounts of gas hydrate CH(4) (delta(13)C = -60 parts per thousand PDB). The temporal coincidence of the cement layer with the PTB suggests that the process that promoted seafloor cementation was also responsible for the biological crisis. A cementation model is developed based on accumulation-dissociation cycle of gas hydrates which also explains the mass extinction at the PTB. The Upper Permian accumulation period of gas hydrates ended abruptly adjacent to the PTB and the dissociation event began releasing 3.2 to 4.7 X 10(18) g CH(4) into the ocean. Oxidation of CH(4) in the water column created a seawater that was charged with CO(2) (an oceanic acid bath) and had lower than normal O(2) content (but not anoxic). This oceanic acid bath first dissolved suspended fine-grained carbonate particles and small calcareous organisms, followed by extensive dissolution of platform carbonates raising Ca(2+) and HCO(3)(-) concentrations of seawater. When the release of CH(4) declined, the acid-bath ocean became a soda ocean precipitating massive amount of seafloor cements observed globally at the PTB. The study suggests that prior to cement precipitation, the PTB ocean was charged with CO(2), warm, had low oxygen, high Ca(2+) and high HCO(3)(-) concentrations. These conditions collectively created stressful conditions causing the marine mass mortality. The leakage of CH(4) to the atmosphere produced a super-hot climate resulting in the biological devastation on land. The proposed kill mechanism is developed on the basis of the physical clue-the cement layer-left behind by the killing process-the change in ocean chemistry. The accumulation-dissociation cycles of gas hydrates also explain the delta(13)C pattern of marine carbonates and the periodicity of mass extinction events during the Phanerozoic. Accumulation periods were long (5 to 20 My) providing favorable conditions for ecosystem development (Pardeess phase). The dissociation events were short and catastrophic (10 to 500 Ky) causing low oxygenation, super-hot climate, and biological devastation (Doozakh phase). It appears that most mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic have been related to the internal working of the Earth system. During the Phanerozoic, methane has played the role of the Deev Jahi-a female demon in Persian mythology-whose task is to attack the Earth every so often to kill life on land and in sea.

abstract = {In order to evaluate details of the partitioning behaviours of Y, rare earth elements (REEs), and Ti between inorganic metal oxide surfaces and seawater, we studied the distribution of these elements in hydrogenetic marine ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts from the Central Pacific Ocean. Nonphosphatized Fe-Mn crusts display shale-normalized rare earths and yttrium (REYSN) patterns (Y inserted between Dy and Ho) that are depleted in light REEs (LREEs) and which show negative anomalies for YSN, and positive anomalies for LaSN, EuSN, GdSN, and in most cases, CeSN. They show considerably smaller Y/ Ho ratios than seawater or common igneous and clastic rocks, indicating that Y and Ho are fractionated in the marine environment. Compared to P-poor crusts, REYSN patterns of phosphatized Fe-Mn crusts are similar, but yield pronounced positive YSN anomalies, stronger positive LaSN anomalies, and enrichment of the HREEs relative to the MREEs. The data suggest modification of REY during phosphatization and indicate that studies requiring primary REY distributions or isotopic ratios should be restricted to nonphosphatized (layers of) Fe-Mn crusts. Apparent bulk coefficients, KMD, describing trace metal partitioning between nonphosphatized hydrogenetic Fe-Mn crusts and seawater, are similar for Pr to Eu and decrease for Eu to Yb. Exceptionally high values of KCeD, which are similar to those of Ti, result from oxidative scavenging of Ce and support previous suggestions that Ce(IV) is a hydroxide-dominated element in seawater. Yttrium and Gd show lower KD values than their respective neighbours in the REY series. Results of modelling the exchange equilibrium between REY dissolved in seawater and REY sorbed on hydrous Fe-Mn oxides corroborate previous studies that suggested the surface complexation of REY can be approximated by their first hydroxide binding constant. Negative "anomalies" occur for stabilities of bulk surface complexes of Gd, La, and particularly Y. The differences in inorganic surface complex stability between Y and Ho and between Gd and its REE neighbours are similar to those shown by the stabilities of complexes with aminocarboxylic acids and are significantly larger than those shown by stabilities of complexes with carboxylic acids. Hence, sorption of Y and REEs onto hydrous Fe-Mn oxides may contribute significantly to the positive YSN and GdSN anomalies in seawater.},

abstract = {Late Paleocene and Early Eocene climates and ecosystems underwent significant change during several transient global warming phases, associated with rapidly increasing atmospheric carbon concentrations, of which the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; similar to 55.5 Ma) is best studied. While biotic response to the PETM as a whole (similar to 170 kyrs) has been relatively well documented, variations during the PETM have been neglected. Here we present organic dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) distribution patterns across two stratigraphically expanded PETM sections from the New Jersey Shelf, Bass River and Wilson Lake. Many previously studied sites show a uniform abundance of the thermophilic and presumably heterotrophic taxon Apectodinium that spans the entire carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of the PETM. In contrast, the New Jersey sections show large variations in abundances of many taxa. during the PETM, including the new species Florentinia reichartii that we formally propose. We infer paleoecological preferences of taxa that show temporal abundance peaks, both qualitative and absolute quantitative, from empirical as well as statistical information, i.e., principle (PCA) and canonical correspondence analyses (CCA). In the CCAs, we combine the dinocyst data with previously published environmental proxy data from these locations, such as TEX86 paleothermometry, magnetic susceptibility and sedimentary size fraction. The combined information supports previous inferences that sea level rose during the PETM, but also indicates a (regional) increase in fresh-water runoff that started similar to 10 kyr after the onset of the CIE, and perhaps precession-paced cycles in sea surface productivity. The highly variable dinocyst assemblages of the PETM contrast with rather stable Upper Paleocene assemblages, which suggests that carbon input caused a dynamic climate state, at least regionally.},

abstract = {Variations in the carbon isotopic compositions of marine carbonate and organic carbon provide a record of changes in the fraction of organic carbon buried through time and may provide clues to changes in rates of weathering and sources of organic carbon. Paired carbonate and organic carbon isotope determinations provide a possibility of interpreting not only changes in the global carbon cycle through time, but changes in atmospheric pCO(2) as well. Interpretations of these types of data are typically rather qualitative; a quantitative basis is required to develop a better understanding of changes in the carbon cycle. For this purpose, we employ a simple model of the global carbon cycle which is subjected to a number of different perturbations, each lasting 500 ky, i.e., much longer than the residence times of carbon and phosphorus in the ocean-atmosphere system. In addition to standard considerations of carbon mass and isotopic fluxes to the ocean-atmosphere system from weathering and volcanism and fluxes of organic carbon and carbonate-carbon to sediments, the model ;incorporates sensitivity of the photosynthetic carbon isotope effect to changes in pCO(2). The inclusion of this parameter leads to unexpected carbon isotope responses to forcing that causes increased rates of organic carbon burial. A series of simple to more complex simulations illustrates the significant effects of varying differences between the carbon isotopic composition of sedimented carbonate and organic carbon (Delta(B)). With constant Delta(B) a 50{\%} increase in organic carbon burial produces a parallel increase in carbonate and organic carbon isotopic compositions. However, the same simulation with Delta(B) responsive to pCO(2) changes produces an initial parallel delta(13)C increase, but this is followed by an even greater C-13-enrichment in organic carbon because pCO(2) falls in response to increased organic carbon burial. The counterintuitive overall result of the enhanced organic carbon burial event is that the carbonate carbon isotopic composition actually decreases because of the more substantial increase in delta(13)C(org). In addition, we illustrate the effects on carbon isotopic compositions of the oceanic inorganic carbon reservoir and buried organic matter of a 50{\%} increase in volcanic CO2 outgassing, a 50{\%} increase in weathering rate (with coupled phosphate and riverine carbon flux responses), a 50{\%} decrease in shale-associated organic carbon weathering, a 50{\%} decrease in silicate weathering rate, and the possible effects of the rise in abundance of C-4 plants in the late Miocene to Recent. We compare the model simulated carbon isotopic responses for some of these experiments to paired carbonate- and organic-carbon records to illustrate how these records might be interpreted in light of the model response.

Interrelationships among variables suggest long-term interactions among continental flooding, sulfur and carbon cycling, and macroevolution. Thus, mutual responses to interacting Earth systems, not sampling biases, explain much of the observed covariation between Phanerozoic patterns of sedimentation and fossil biodiversity.

Late Riphean carbonates and organic material show a stratigraphically useful pattern of enrichment in 13C relative to Phanerozoic or earlier Proterozoic samples.  Isotopic compositions of isolated samples from other localities are consistent with a worldwide extended interval of enhanced organic burial and consequent net survival of oxidized material, probably O2, just before the initial radiation of metazoans.},

abstract = {Marine biodiversity decreases and ecosystem destruction during the end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) have been linked to widespread marine euxinic conditions. Changes in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), and marine dissolved sulfate concentrations during the Permian-Triassic transition can provide insights into the role of ocean chemistry change in the largest mass extinction in Earth history. In this study, we constrain marine dissolved sulfate concentrations using the MSR-trend method of Algeo et al. [Algeo, T.J., Luo, G.M., Song, H.Y., Lyons, T.W., Canfield, D.E., 2015. Reconstruction of secular variation in seawater sulfate concentrations. Biogeosciences 12, 2131–2151] on sulfur (S) isotope records from Iran (the Kuh-e-Ali Bashi and Zal sections) and Hungary (the B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny North and B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny East sections). This empirically derived transfer function is based on the S isotope fractionation between sulfate and sulfide associated with MSR in natural aquatic environments. This fractionation is proxied by the difference in S-isotope compositions between chromium-reducible sulfur (CRS) and carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), i.e., $\Delta$34SCAS-CRS. We show that, despite region-specific redox conditions, $\Delta$34SCAS-CRS exhibits a nearly invariant value of 15–16‰ in both study sections. By comparing our record with a $\Delta$34Ssulfate-sulfide density distribution for modern marine sediments, we deduce that porewater Rayleigh distillation, carbonate diagenesis, and other effects are unlikely to have appreciably altered the S-isotope offset between CRS and CAS in the study sections. In addition, differences in sedimentary regimes and organic carbon (OC) fluxes between the Iranian and Hungarian sections exclude major influence of the electron donor on MSR-S isotope fractionation and point to a more universal control, i.e., contemporaneous seawater sulfate concentration. The MSR-trend transfer function yielded estimates of seawater sulfate of 0.6–2.8mM for the latest Permian to earliest Triassic, suggesting a balanced oceanic S-cycle with equal S inputs and outputs and no major changes in sulfate concentrations during this interval. However, a secular trend toward heavier $\delta$34SCAS (by {\textgreater}5‰) in the earliest Triassic can be explained only by increasing the turnover rate of the S-cycle (by ca. one order of magnitude) and a concomitant change in terrestrial S sources in a box model experiment. Exposure of evaporite deposits having a high $\delta$34S may account for the source change, with a possible role for the Siberian Traps volcanism by magmatic remobilization of Cambrian rock salt. A high sulfur cycle turnover rate would have left the ocean system vulnerable to development of widespread euxinic conditions, posing a sustained threat to marine life during the Early Triassic.},

abstract = {Organic carbon-rich sediments are enriched in several redox-sensitive and stable sulfide-forming trace metals (TM) and form an important sink in global TM cycles. In today's ocean such sediments are deposited in coastal upwelling areas like those in the Gulf of California, off Peru or off the Namibian coast and euxinic basins like the Black Sea. In an attempt to distinguish both environments by their specific TM patterns, some important conclusions may be drawn: 1) The TM enrichment seen in both environments broadly is rather similar. 2) Upwelling sediments are often enriched in Cd and P and depleted in Co and Mn. 3) Sapropels have a tendency towards higher enrichments in Ba and Mo, S, Re, As, Cu, Ni, Sb, and Fe, reflecting the strong sulfidation in an anoxic water column. 4) Upwelling systems cover a broad range of environmental settings where the steepness of the slope, the proximity of H2S to the sediment seawater interface and the intensity of bio-accumulation and regeneration play an important role for TM accumulation. 5) The TM content of anoxic basins is mainly controlled by TM availability in the water column and sedimentation rate. 6) Enhanced bio-productivity is the main switch turning an oxygenated into an anoxic environment. Cretaceous black shales (OAE 2) exhibit TM signatures of both, coastal upwelling areas and sapropels. The strong enrichments in Cd, Mo, Tl, V, Cu, Ni, (Bi), and Sb demonstrate that bio-accumulation and presence of H2S in the water column and associated sulfidation processes persisted during this time interval in large parts of the Proto-Atlantic. The usefulness of Ba as a paleoproductivity-proxy is obscured by diagenesis. The extreme accumulation in Ag and Zn requires either an additional TM source, for instance hydrothermal input, or a different TM seawater composition during the Cretaceous. The geochemical data suggest, that the major driving force for the widespread occurrence of C/T black shales seems to be the increase in volcanic activity and associated CO2-input throughout the Cretaceous. The ocean-atmosphere system operated in a mode different from today during this time interval. After conversion of the "nutrient" CO2 into organic matter the system switched back into the "normal" operational mode. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction greatly diminished marine diversity and brought about a whole-scale restructuring of marine ecosystems; these ecosystem changes also profoundly affected the sedimentary record. Data presented here, attained through facies analyses of strata deposited during the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (southern Turkey) and at the close of the Early Triassic (southwestern United States), in combination with a literature review, show that sedimentary systems were profoundly affected by: (1) a reduction in biotic diversity and abundance and (2) long-term environmental fluctuations that resulted from the end-Permian crisis. Lower Triassic strata display widespread microbialite and carbonate seafloor fan development and contain indicators of suppressed infaunal bioturbation such as flat-pebble conglomerates and wrinkle structures (facies considered unusual in post-Cambrian subtidal deposits). Our observations suggest that depositional systems, too, respond to biotic crises, and that certain facies may act as barometers of ecologic and environmental change independent of fossil assemblage analyses. Close investigation of facies changes during other critical times in Earth history may serve as an important tool in interpreting the ecology of metazoans and their environment. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Late Devonian glaciation is well-documented in three Brazilian basins, and newer work has shown a wider extent for this event, reaching Bolivia, Peru, Central African Republic, Niger, and the USA. Physical evidence for this event includes glacial pavements and polymict striated, and faceted clasts as dropstones and within marine resedimented deposits. Late Devonian (Frasnian? and Famennian) onset of Gondwanaland's glaciations resulted in fundamental changes in coeval and later (Mississippian) depositional systems worldwide. Palynomorphs date the more widespread event within the Retispora lepidophyta (miospore) palynozone, which often occurs with the marine acritarch Umbellasphaeridium saharicum. This initial glaciation continued into earliest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) time. There were several consequences from the short-term glacioeustasy. In North America, central Europe and southern China there is a coeval sea-level fall that exhumed and eroded carbonate platforms, deposited siliciclastics, and generated lacunae in the Famennian record. The lowstand resulted in extensive carbonate breccias, shallow-water deposits and evaporites in western U.S.A. Lowstand clastic wedges were deposited in a regression (eastern U.S.A.) with widespread black shales. In Moravia, Famennian siliciclastic influx increased as a result of subaerial weathering in newly-emergent highs that resulted from sea-level drop. Partial sea-level drops were also manifested by ferruginous oolites, which developed in nearshore environments and were subsequently dispersed down adjacent slopes by storm resedimentation. In southern China, aggradation, siliciclastic influx, reflux-dolomitization from evaporation, and shallow-water carbonate resulted from Famennian sea-level fall. The coupling of glacial and lowstand events explains the sudden appearance of shallow-marine, as well as subaerially-affected features after the Frasnian transgression that breached the North American craton. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {New crystalline structures have been observed in argon ion-milled conodont elements from a diverse suite of Ordovician taxa (‘Cordylodus robustus', Drepanoistodus suberectus, Panderodus gracilis, Plectodina? sp., Aphelognathus sp., Periodon aculeatus), using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electron diffraction patterns of albid tissue reveal that the component crystals are extraordinarily large, in the order of hundred(s) of microns. These large albid crystals show typical cancellate porosity, although a distinctly lamellar structure has also been observed within a large albid crystal positioned between hyaline lamellar and cancellate albid tissues. There is a distinct absence of ‘interlamellar space' within all hyaline tissues examined, which are characterized by a polycrystalline matrix of micron-scale elongate crystals that are both strongly aligned and tightly bound within a broader lamellar structure. Optical opacity, caused by light scattering within large (≥ 0.5 µm) pores, is also a feature of both albid and polycrystalline lamellar crown tissues. Accordingly, conodont hard tissues are differentiated by crystal size and shape, as well as inter- and intracrystalline porosity. These new observations highlight the structural complexities of conodont histologies and the need for more comprehensive investigations particularly of transitional crown tissues, which are not well defined by terms typically used in the literature. Their histological structures are interpreted to be a product of in vivo crystallization and thus provide new insights into the relative porosity, permeability, and inherent integrity of the tissues as well as their growth relationships. Accordingly, these data not only have implications for earlier histological and palaeobiological interpretations of conodont hard tissues but are also fundamental in determining their chemical integrity, which is crucial for characterizing palaeoseawater composition and palaeoenvironmental change. The potential for conodont apatite to retain primary chemical information depends on crystal size and permeability, so the large albid crystal domains are consistent with parallel geochemical studies that suggest that cancellate albid crown is more resistant to diagenetic modification.},

abstract = {Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in mammalian tooth enamel are commonly used to understand the diets and environments of modern and fossil animals. Isotope variation during the period of enamel formation can be recovered by intra-tooth microsampling along the direction of growth. However, conventional sampling of the enamel surface provides highly time-averaged records in part due to amelogenesis. We use backscattered electron imaging in the scanning electron microscope (BSE-SEM) to evaluate enamel mineralization in developing teeth from one rodent and two ungulates. Gray levels from BSE-SEM images suggest that the innermost enamel layer, {\textless}20$\mu$m from the enamel-dentine junction, is highly mineralized early in enamel maturation and therefore may record a less attenuated isotopic signal than other layers. We sampled the right maxillary incisor from a woodrat subjected to an experimentally induced water-switch during the period of tooth development, and demonstrate that secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) can be used to obtain $\delta$18O values with 4-5-$\mu$m spots from mammalian tooth enamel. We also demonstrate that SIMS can be used to discretely sample the innermost enamel layer, which is too narrow for conventional microdrilling or laser ablation. An abrupt $\delta$18O switch of 16.0{\%} was captured in breath CO2, a proxy for body water, while a laser ablation enamel surface intra-tooth profile of the left incisor captured a $\delta$18O range of 12.1{\%}. The innermost enamel profile captured a $\delta$18O range of 15.7{\%}, which approaches the full magnitude of $\delta$18O variation in the input signal. This approach will likely be most beneficial in taxa such as large mammalian herbivores, whose teeth are characterized by less rapid mineralization and therefore greater attenuation of the enamel isotope signal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hemipelagic sediments from the northeastern Arabian Sea off Pakistan were analyzed by geochemical and microscopical methods to study the importance of bacterial degradation processes on the quantity and composition of sedimentary organic matter (OM). On the basis of elemental analysis of total organic carbon (TOC) and total sulfur (TS), the decay of OM by sulfate-reducing bacteria were calculated. Concentrations of total iron, reactive iron, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and hydrogen indices (HI) were used to assess organic matter reactivity and redox conditions. Stable sulfur isotopic compositions provided further information about pathway, timing and mechanisms of sulfate reduction. Microscopical observations indicate that throughout the study area, OM is amorphous (75–95{\%}) in almost all samples with only a small contribution of terrigenous OM. Bacterially mediated sulfate reduction leads to continuously decreasing TOC/TS ratios from 0.4 m to a burial depth of 2–3 m. At this depth, the anaerobic oxidation of particulate organic matter ceases. Sulfate reduction in this narrow interval accounts for the decay of up to 70{\%} of the OM which has primarily entered the anoxic domain. During the bacterially mediated diagenesis preferential consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus containing organic compounds can be observed and quantified. The regeneration of up to 60{\%} of TN and more than 50{\%} of TP can lead to a feedback of nutrients to the seawater. This recycling process may contribute to the high productivity in the northeastern Arabian Sea.},

abstract = {A simplified and more accurate version of the quantitative paleoenvironmental method proposed by Imbrie and Kipp (1971) is described, which is based on untransformed rather than transformed species per cent data. The method yields faunal indices (Ts, Tw, S), useful both as objective measures of paleontological properties and as estimates of Pleistocene sea-surface summer and winter temperatures (Ts, Tw) and salinity (S). Similarly, the oxygen-isotope method yields objective measurements of $\delta$ O18, useful stratigraphically and as indications of past changes in isotopic water composition and temperature. Laboratory errors of the two methods have about the same magnitude relative to ranges observed in V12-122. Accuracy of faunal indices as estimates of oceanic conditions is evaluated by study of modern oceanographic data and sea-bed samples. Under favorable conditions, accuracy is apparently limited primarily by the degree of ecological control exercised by the estimated parameter. Accuracy of the isotopic paleotemperature estimates is limited primarily by uncertainty as to the magnitude of the water-correction term in the isotope equation, a value which combines global ice-volume and local evaporation-precipitation effects. Curves of $\delta$ O13 and S in V12-122 record all or part of seven major climatic cycles, and display a fundamental periodicity of about 85,000 years. Ts and Tw curves show small but significant differences: two phase shifts in estimated temperature minima, and a long-term increasing trend. Amplitude-frequency histograms of Tw and $\delta$ O18 indicate that only two percent of the time during the past 450,000 years have Caribbean temperatures been as warm and isotopic ratios as low as they are today. A comparison of the magnitude of $\delta$ O18 change (2.2{\%}.) during the shift from late-glacial to post-glacial times, with that of the faunally estimated change in average temperature (2.2°C), provides a basis for estimating the associated change in isotopic water composition (1.8{\%}.) by back-calculation in the isotope equation. At least 0.4{\%}. of this change in A is attributed to an evaporation-precipitation effect, and the balance (≤1.4{\%}.) to an icevolume effect. Isotopic and faunal methods monitor different responses to global climatic change. Used in conjunction, they provide deeper insights into the past than either could achieve alone.},

abstract = {The existence of unusually large fluctuations in the Neoproterozoic (1,000-543 million years ago) carbon-isotopic record implies strong perturbations to the Earth's carbon cycle. To analyze these fluctuations, we examine records of both the isotopic content of carbonate carbon and the fractionation between carbonate and marine organic carbon. Together, these are inconsistent with conventional, steady-state models of the carbon cycle. The records can be well understood, however, as deriving from the nonsteady dynamics of two reactive pools of carbon. The lack of a steady state is traced to an unusually large oceanic reservoir of organic carbon. We suggest that the most significant of the Neoproterozoic negative carbon-isotopic excursions resulted from increased remineralization of this reservoir. The terminal event, at the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary, signals the final diminution of the reservoir, a process that was likely initiated by evolutionary innovations that increased export of organic matter to the deep sea.},

abstract = {Significantly different Guadalupian-Late Triassic patterns are observed in the evolution of attached and isolated carbonate platforms of the southwestern Tethys (Oman Mountains). Close to the rim of the attached Arabian platform, carbonates of the Saiq and Mahil Formations reveal an almost complete Permian-Triassic sedimentary record. Guadalupian-Changhsingian 3rd order sequences consist of fossiliferous transgressive systems tracts and monotonous highstand systems tracts with mud/wackestone and coral bafflestone. The youngest Changhsingian beds are bioturbated floatstone with crinoids, sponges and bryozoans. All sediments indicate a healthy, tropical carbonate production. Above, a unique facies change begins with a pyrite-encrusted omission surface. Greenish mudstone rich in authigenic pyrite infills the relief of the unconformity and is overlain by clastic sediment and by laminated, microbialite-bearing carbonate. Unfossiliferous sediments and seafloor cements indicate a change in carbonate production towards abiotic processes. Prevailing anoxic conditions were interrupted by seven oxic event beds, as indicated either by low-diversity and small-sized ichnotaxa or by shell beds with low-diversity bivalve and crinoid assemblages. By comparison with published data, the described sedimentary sequence can be assigned to the Changhsingian-earliest Griesbachian. Beginning probably with the Anisian, bioturbated Griesbachian-Dienerian recovery period and the unconformity below to the latest grain-supported sediment textures mark the return to biogenic tropical carbonate production under oxic conditions. The Middle-Late Triassic carbonate platform consists of stacked high-frequency shallowing upward cycles. By contrast, carbonate production of Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms was discontinuous and interrupted by a large gap. Guadalupian deposits of the Al Jil Formation consist of bioclastic limestone typical of a tropical carbonate production. The uppermost bed, an impoverished bioclastic packstone capped by an unconformity, marks the onset of platform drowning which resulted from the end-Guadalupian mass extinction. Above, a polymict breccia witnessed rift pulses of the Neo-Tethys. The overlying pelagic mud- and packstone contains radiolarians and rare foraminifera of Lopingian age, and overlying microbialites. In the Carnian, tropical shallow-water carbonate production restarted with a low-relief platform and culminated in a Norian-Rhaetian reef-rimmed platform. Stacked Lofer cycles dominated the inner platform of Jebel Kawr (Misfah Formation). We here propose a differential onset and severity of the Late Permian mass extinctions for carbonate platforms. On the Arabian Plate, tropical carbonate production collapsed after the end-Lopingian mass extinction and was replaced by microbialites and sea-floor cements during the earliest Triassic. After approximately six million years, tropical shallow-water carbonate production resumed in the Middle Triassic. Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms drowned shortly after the end-Guadalupian mass extinction and did not recover before the Late Triassic. Absence of shallow-water limestone suggests that carbonate production of isolated platforms ceased for about 30 million years, a period exceeding the recovery of most marine ecosystems.

abstract = {We present a detailed curve of seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 for the Middle Permian to Triassic based on analyses of conodonts from overlapping sections in the U.S.A, and Pakistan, correlated using conodont biostratigraphy. The isotope ratio decreased in the Middle Permian at an average rate of 0.000062 Ma(-1), reached a minimum in the Capitanian (257-258 Ma), and increased in the Late Permian at an average rate of 0.000097 Ma(-1). The Late Permian rate of increase was roughly two and a half times greater than the average increase over the past 40 Ma, and approximately equal to the highest Cenozoic rates, which occurred over much shorter time intervals. Modeling results suggest that decreasing Middle Permian Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were driven by changes in the riverine Sr flux to the oceans, while increasing ratios in the Late Permian/Triassic are attributed to both increased riverine Sr-87/Sr-86 and flux. The reduced Middle Permian riverine flux coincides with extreme continental aridity associated with the formation of Pangea and recorded by massive evaporite deposits. In addition, mountains in the equatorial region of Pangea may have created a rain shadow, thereby minimizing precipitation in regions that currently contribute the bulk of chemical weathering products to the ocean. Increasing riverine Sr-87/Sr-86 in the Late Permian is suggested by the observation that Nd-143/Nd-144 values decrease at the same time; however, the source of radiogenic Sr is not known. Frequently cited mechanisms for increasing Sr-87/Sr-86 in runoff, such as glaciations and continent-to-continent collisions, coincide instead with decreasing seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 in the Middle Permian. One possible source may have been deep erosion into older orogens, associated with a dramatic increase in chemical weathering in the Late Permian. The cause of enhanced weathering appears to have been increased levels of atmospheric CO2 with associated global warming and increased humidity. Proposed sources of CO2 include dissociation of gas hydrates and oxidation of organic matter during extreme sea level regression, as well as volcanic emissions from Siberian Traps eruptions. Continental floral and faunal distributions are consistent with this interpretation, as are oceanic delta(13)C patterns and variations in shallow-water sediment lithologies.},

abstract = {Diversity dynamics of the PermianTriassic land plants in South China are studied by analyzing paleobotanical data. Our results indicate that the total diversity of land-plant megafossil genera and species across the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB) of South China underwent a progressive decline from the early Late Permian (Wuchiapingian) to the Early-Middle Triassic. In contrast, the diversity of land-plant microfossil genera exhibited only a small fluctuation across the PTB of South China, showing an increase at the PTB. Overall, land plants across the PTB of South China show a greater stability in diversity dynamics than marine faunas. The highest extinction rate (90.91{\%}) and the lowest origination rate (18.18{\%}) of land-plant megafossil genera occurred at the early Early Triassic (Induan), but the temporal duration of the higher genus extinction rates ({\textgreater}60{\%}) in land plants was about 23.4 Myr, from the Wuchiapingian to the early Middle Triassic (Anisian), which is longer than that of the coeval marine faunas (3-11 Myr). Moreover, the change of genus turnover rates in land-plant megafossils steadily fluctuated from the late Early Permian to the Late Triassic. More stable diversity and turnover rate as well as longer extinction duration suggest that land plants near the PTB of South China may have been involved in a gradual floral reorganization and evolutionary replacement rather than a mass extinction like those in the coeval marine faunas. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Paleontological Society.

However, observational limitations have hindered a direct evaluation of model-projected changes in extreme precipitation. We used satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content. These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.},

@article{Jørgensen2004,
abstract = {The main terminal processes of organic matter mineralization in anoxic Black Sea sediments underlying the sulfidic water column are sulfate reduction in the upper 2-4 m and methanogenesis below the sulfate zone. The modern marine deposits comprise a ca. 1-m-deep layer of coccolith ooze and underlying sapropel, below which sea water ions penetrate deep down into the limnic Pleistocene deposits from {\textgreater}9000 years BP. Sulfate reduction rates have a subsurface maximum at the SO4$\backslash$n2--CH4 transition where H2S reaches maximum concentration. Because of an excess of reactive iron in the deep limnic deposits, most of the methane-derived H2S is drawn downward to a sulfidization front where it reacts with Fe(III) and with Fe2+ diffusing up from below. The H2S-Fe2+ transition is marked by a black band of amorphous iron sulfide above which distinct horizons of greigite and pyrite formation occur. The pore water gradients respond dynamically to environmental changes in the Black Sea with relatively short time constants of ca. 500 yr for SO4$\backslash$n2- and 10 yr for H2S, whereas the FeS in the black band has taken ca. 3000 yr to accumulate. The dual diffusion interfaces of SO4$\backslash$n2--CH4 and H2S-Fe2+ cause the trapping of isotopically heavy iron sulfide with $\delta$34S = +15 to +33‰ at the sulfidization front. A diffusion model for sulfur isotopes shows that the SO4$\backslash$n2- diffusing downward into the SO4$\backslash$n2--CH4 transition has an isotopic composition of +19‰, close to the +23‰ of H2S diffusing upward. These isotopic compositions are, however, very different from the porewater SO4$\backslash$n2- (+43‰) and H2S (-15‰) at the same depth. The model explains how methane-driven sulfate reduction combined with a deep H2S sink leads to isotopically heavy pyrite in a sediment open to diffusion. These results have general implications for the marine sulfur cycle and for the interpretation of sulfur isotopic data in modern sediments and in sedimentary rocks throughout earth's history. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Global environmental changes, including ocean acidification, have been identified as a major threat to scleractinian corals. General predictions are that ocean acidification will be detrimental to reef growth and that 40 to more than 80 per cent of present-day reefs will decline during the next 50 years. Cold-water corals (CWCs) are thought to be strongly affected by changes in ocean acidification owing to their distribution in deep and/or cold waters, which naturally exhibit a CaCO(3) saturation state lower than in shallow/warm waters. Calcification was measured in three species of Mediterranean cold-water scleractinian corals (Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum dianthus) on-board research vessels and soon after collection. Incubations were performed in ambient sea water. The species M. oculata was additionally incubated in sea water reduced or enriched in CO(2). At ambient conditions, calcification rates ranged between -0.01 and 0.23{\%} d(-1). Calcification rates of M. oculata under variable partial pressure of CO(2) (pCO(2)) were the same for ambient and elevated pCO(2) (404 and 867 µatm) with 0.06 ± 0.06{\%} d(-1), while calcification was 0.12 ± 0.06{\%} d(-1) when pCO(2) was reduced to its pre-industrial level (285 µatm). This suggests that present-day CWC calcification in the Mediterranean Sea has already drastically declined (by 50{\%}) as a consequence of anthropogenic-induced ocean acidification.},

abstract = {Sedimentological, palaeontological, and geochemical data of a 152-m thick composite section of the Saiq Formation were used to describe the facies associations and the nature of carbonate precipitation during the Late Permian–Early Triassic at the eastern rim of the Arabian Platform (Sultanate of Oman, Saih Hatat, Wadi Aday). Changhsingian (Late Permian) platform carbonates, dominated by bryozoans, brachiopods and crinoids, are truncated by a mineralized discontinuity surface. The disappearance of Permian calcified metazoans, a negative $\delta$13Ccarb excursion, and a sharp facies contrast collectively suggest that the Permian–Triassic boundary lies in this interval. Unfossiliferous siliciclastics with nodules of iron and manganese minerals on top of the unconformity were probably deposited during a phase when sea water was undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate. After a gap, late Dienerian carbonate deposition started with abiotically precipitated lime mudstone and biotically induced microbialites having the lowest observed $\delta$13Ccarb values (facies association A). Further up, 1–2 m of bioclastic wacke- and grainstones with a positive $\delta$13Ccarb excursion indicate a short-lived interval of biotically controlled carbonate precipitation (facies association B). The overlying sequence of siliciclastics, laminated or bioturbated dolomitized mudstone, microbialites, dolomitic siltstone, and black calcite, which is characterized by a 2nd negative $\delta$13Ccarb shift, marks the return to biotically induced carbonate precipitation (facies associations C–D). The recrystallized black calcite at the top of the sequence is capped by a thick palaeosol and overlain by late Early to Middle Triassic cycles consisting of biotically precipitated carbonate. The facies development of the rim of the Arabian Platform differs from that of the interior in having a pronounced discontinuity at the Permian–Triassic boundary and an Early Triassic bioclastic carbonate unit sandwiched between abiotically precipitated carbonates. The observed lateral changes in carbonate precipitation across the Arabian Platform could have been caused by changes in oceanic circulation, such as episodic upwelling of deep water.},

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the P-Tr extinction was caused by the Siberian basaltic flood volcanism. It is likely that the eruption of these magmas was accompanied by the injection of large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere, which may have led to global cooling and to expansion of the polar ice cap. The P-Tr extinction event may have been caused by a combination of acid rain and global cooling as well as rapid and extreme changes in sea level resulting from expansion of the polar ice cap.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction was followed by the formation of an enigmatic rock layer with a distinctive macroscopic spotted or dendroid fabric. This deposit has been interpreted as microbial reef rock, digitate dendrolite, digital thrombolite, dendritic thrombolite, or bacterial deposits. Agreement has been reached in considering them as microbialites, but not in their formation. This study has revealed that the spotted and dendroid microbialites were composed of numerous fossil casts formed by the planktic cyanobacterium, Microcystis, a coccoid genus that at the present-day commonly forms blooms in modern lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. The abundance of the fossils and the diagenesis they experienced has determined the macroscopic fabric: where they abundant, the rock appears as dendroid, otherwise, it appears as spotted. The ancient Microcystis bloom might produce toxin to kill other metazoans, and be responsible for the oceanic anoxia that has puzzled so many researchers for so many years.},

abstract = {We used sediment traps to define the particulate fluxes of barium and organic carbon and investigate the use of barium as a proxy for ocean fertility. Strong correlations between C-org and Ba fluxes indicate a link between upper ocean biological processes and barium flux to the seafloor. The ratio of organic carbon to barium decreases systematically with water depth. Data from 10 sites indicate that organic debris settling from the 200-m depth has a C-org/Ba ratio of approximately 200. The systematic decrease in this ratio with increasing water depth results from the simultaneous decay of organic matter and uptake of Ba in settling particles. This behavior provides additional evidence that the formation of in oceanic particles is a consequence of decomposition/uptake in microenvironments rather than the secretion of barite by specific organisms. The decrease of the Corg/Ba ratio with depth is greatest in the North Pacific followed by the equatorial Pacific and is lowest in the western Atlantic. Since this spatial pattern in consistent with the variations in the deep-ocean barium contents which increase along the path of bottom water flow from the Atlantic to the North Pacific, it suggests that the particulate barium uptake and flux is enhanced by higher barium contents in the intermediate and deep waters of the ocean. Consequently, we have combined our particle flux data with existing water column Ba data to define an algorithm relating new productivity, dissolved barium contents, water depth, and particulate barium flux. This relationship provides a basis of applying barium flux measurements in sediments to estimating new production. In order to use barium as an indicator of productivity, it will be necessary to evaluate inputs from hydrothermal and aluminosilicate sources and xenophyophors. The application of a sequential leach procedure to the trap material indicates that 50-70{\%} of the Ba in settling particles is in the form of barite and the remaining is adsorbed or bound to carbonates. Normative analysis demonstrates that in nearshore areas the contribution of barium from aluminosilicate sources can dominate that from biogenic inputs. It appears that normative estimates of biogenic barium contents can be made with accuracy if less than 50{\%} of the Ba is associated with diagenetic mobilization of Ba can occur in reduced and suboxic sediments, highly productive nearshore areas also are likely to be inappropriate sites to use Ba measurements as productivity indicators. Comparisons between the rain rates of particulate Ba to the seafloor and the burial rate indicate the approximately 30{\%} of the Ba rain is preserved. Although the preservation factor does not appear to be constant, it may be possible to predict the extent of preservation from an empirical relationship with the mass accumulation rate. These observations indicate that measurement of Ba burial fluxes in sediments can provide quantitative information on the paleoproductivity of the oceans. Joining the relationship between barium rain and burial with the barium and organic carbon algorithm, we make estimate of the new production in the northern California Current during the last 18,000 years. This calculation suggests that new production was at least a factor 2 lower at this site during the last glacial maximum.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to have significant influences on terrestrial biodiversity at all system levels, including species-level reductions in range size and abundance, especially amongst endemic species(1-6). However, little is known about how mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions could reduce biodiversity impacts, particularly amongst common and widespread species. Our global analysis of future climatic range change of common and widespread species shows that without mitigation, 57 +/- 6{\%} of plants and 34 +/- 7{\%} of animals are likely to lose {\textgreater}= 50{\%} of their present climatic range by the 2080s. With mitigation, however, losses are reduced by 60{\%} if emissions peak in 2016 or 40{\%} if emissions peak in 2030. Thus, our analyses indicate that without mitigation, large range contractions can be expected even amongst common and widespread species, amounting to a substantial global reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services by the end of this century. Prompt and stringent mitigation, on the other hand, could substantially reduce range losses and buy up to four decades for climate change adaptation.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: A fractionation of sulphur isotopes was found in all metabolic processes investigated except those in which elemental sulphur was the starting substrate for growth of Thiobacillus concretivorus and Chromatium sp. and for reduction by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Except for polythionates formed during sulphide oxidation by T. concretivorus or Chromatium sp., the products of metabolism were enriched in 32S relative to the starting substrates. The magnitudes of the enrichment differed for different processes and for the same overall process carried out by different organisms. The {\{}delta{\}}34S values ({\%}0) ranged from -46{\{}middle dot{\}}0 for sulphide from sulphate reduction by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans to +19{\{}middle dot{\}}0 for polythionate formed during growth on sulphide by T. concretivorus. Fractionation during sulphate reduction was inversely proportional to rate of reduction when lactate and ethanol were electron donors and directly proportional with molecular hydrogen as the electron donor. Temperature and sulphate concentration, within the normal physiological ranges of these parameters, influenced fractionation only in so far as they influenced rate of reduction. However, anomalous fractionation effects were obtained at low temperatures and when a resting suspension reducing sulphite was subjected to changes in temperature. The data are discussed with reference to the mechanism(s) of fractionation.},

S isotope data from modern, low-sulfate euxinic systems illustrate that preserved ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values are positively correlated with sulfate concentration. However, absolute constraints on the range of low-sulfate levels over which preserved ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values vary with sulfate concentration remain poorly constrained. Here, we present a compilation of S isotope data for modern euxinic systems demonstrating that preserved ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values increase with sulfate concentration at low sulfate levels and approach values that are similar to in situ S isotope fractionation values from microbial sulfate reduction at high sulfate levels. We compare these results to a closed system model of S isotope cycling in a euxinic ocean in order to evaluate when the size of the sulfate reservoir is sufficiently small that Rayleigh fractionation affects the preservation of S isotope signatures. We conclude that the reservoir effect places constraints on ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values deposited in euxinic settings at sulfate concentrations {\textless}5mM. Thus, over this range, ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values can be used to evaluate ancient sulfate levels. At higher sulfate levels ({\textgreater}10mM), ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values are similar to the kinetic isotope fractionation due to microbial sulfate reduction and therefore provide information about biological and environmental controls on sulfate reduction rates and location of pyrite formation.

abstract = {Carbon isotope (delta (super 13) C) analyses of marine carbonates spanning the Silurian-Devonian transition are compared from three richly fossiliferous, well-dated sequences in North America. The three sections, in the central Appalachian Mountains (West Virginia), Great Basin (Nevada), and the southern Mid-continent (Oklahoma), reveal positive delta (super 13) C shifts beginning in the late Pridoli and reaching peak values as heavy as +5.8 per mil in the earliest Lochkovian following the first occurrence of the conodont species Icriodus woschmidti and the graptolite Monograptus uniformis. A positive shift in delta (super 13) C is also recorded at this time in Gondwanan regions, including the global stratotype section and point for the Silurian-Devonian boundary at Klonk in the Czech Republic, as well as in sections in the Carnic Alps of Austria (Cellon), and Queensland, Australia. The available data from Euramerica and Gondwana are consistent with a scenario linking seawater delta (super 13) C enrichment to a eustatic drop during the Silurian-Devonian transition. Seawater delta (super 13) C likely increased as a result of enhanced carbonate weathering during exposure and erosion of older Silurian platform deposits. In addition, the fall in sea level appears to have enhanced nutrient delivery to the oceans and triggered an increase in organic carbon burial rates at or near the Silurian-Devonian boundary, as indicated by organic-rich deposition in Gondwanan basins. In terms of its magnitude, the Silurian-Devonian delta (super 13) C excursion of {\textgreater} or =+5 per mil appears to be among the largest well-documented events in the Paleozoic, comparable to the shifts in the Late Ordovician and Early Mississippian.},

abstract = {Minor and trace element compositions of a suite of Ordovician, Silurian, and Permian conodonts have been characterised by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). Continuous, high-resolution chemical depth profiles through individual conodont elements reveal systematic compositional differences between the component histologies (albid, hyaline, and basal body tissues). Comparative analyses of contemporaneous bio-apatites (ichthyoliths and inarticulate brachiopods), as well as Holocene and modern fish material, show linear relationships between their respective rare earth element, yttrium, lead, thorium, and uranium compositions, which has implications for their relative permeability and susceptibility to diagenesis. Assessment of LA-ICPMS profiles in the context of histology, general morphological structure, and post-depositional chemical exchange, suggests that conodont albid crown is the least permeable histology, whereas hyaline crown, basal tissue, ichthyoliths, and inarticulate brachiopods are strongly overprinted by the selective uptake of Y-REE-Th-U during diagenesis. Conodont albid crown is therefore more resistant than other bio-apatite histologies to postmortem uptake of Y-REE-Th-U, and trends below detection limits that more closely approach primary conodont compositions. This relationship between sample histology and geochemistry, especially in the context of diagenetic overprinting, demands careful consideration when reconstructing palaeoseawater compositions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

There is a source of sulfate both at the top and the bottom of the sediment column due to the presence of basement fluid flow, which promotes bacterial sulfate reduction below the sulfate minimum zone at elevated temperatures. Pore fluid $\delta$34S data show the highest values (135 ‰) yet found in the marine environment. The bacterial sulfur isotopic fractionation factor, $\alpha$, is severely underestimated if the pore fluids of anoxic marine sediments are assumed to be closed systems and Rayleigh fractionation plots yield erroneous values for $\alpha$ by as much as 15‰ in diffusive and advective pore fluid regimes. Model results are consistent with $\alpha$ = 1.077 ± 0.007 with no temperature effect over the range 1.8 to 62°C and no effect of sulfate reduction rate over the range 2 to 10 pmol cm−3 d−1. The reason for this large isotopic fractionation is unknown, but one difference with previous studies is the very low sulfate reduction rates recorded, about two orders of magnitude lower than literature values that are in the range of $\mu$mol cm−3 d−1 to tens of nmol cm−3 d−1. In general, the greatest 34S depletions are associated with the lowest sulfate reduction rates and vice versa, and it is possible that such extreme fractionation is a characteristic of open systems with low sulfate reduction rates.},

This anoxic, sulfidic episode has been ascribed to both low- and high-productivity states in the marine water column, leaving the causes of euxinia and the mechanisms underlying delayed recovery poorly understood. Here we use isotopic analysis to examine the changing chemical structure of the water column through the recovery interval and thereby better constrain paleoproductivity. The $\delta$13C of limestones from 5 stratigraphic sections in south China displays a negative gradient of approximately 4‰ from shallow-to-deep water facies within the Lower Triassic. This intense gradient declines within Spathian and lowermost Middle Triassic strata, coincident with accelerated biotic recovery and carbon cycle stabilization. Model simulations show that high nutrient levels and a vigorous biological pump are required to sustain such a large gradient in $\delta$13C, indicating that Early Triassic ocean anoxia and delayed recovery of benthic animal ecosystems resulted from too much productivity rather than too little.},

The first occurrence (FO) of H. parvus parvus in the lower Daye Formation, at about 7.45 m above the contact surface between the Upper Permian skeletal packstone and a calcimicrobial framestone unit, is correlated with the Permian-Triassic boundary; the occurrence of H. eurypyge, H. praeparvus and M. ultima immediately below and H. postparvus above the interval supports this interpretation. A morphometric analysis of 31 Hindeodus specimens helped distinguish H. parvus erectus from H. parvus parvus and H. postparvus. Correlation with the Meishan section (PTB GSSP) using both conodont biostratigraphy and carbon isotopes, indicates that the major extinction at the two localities is simultaneous and coincides with the top of the skeletal packstone at Dawen. The contact between the skeletal packstone and the calcimicrobialite is very irregular and has previously been interpreted as a dissolution surface and correlated with a surface in the lower part of bed 27 at Meishan. Our results confirm this interpretation and reveal that the dissolution event postdated the extinction. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Anoxic marine sediments are usually characterized by systematic decrease in concentration of dissolved sulfate in the pore waters of marine sediments. This depletion in dissolved sulfate can take place over depth scales ranging from a few centimeters up to a few hundred meters. Accompanying the decrease in sulfate concentration is an increase in ??34S, due to preferential utilization of the 32S -isotope during bacterial sulfate reduction. The degree of 34S-enrichment for a given degree of dissolved sulfate depletion is also highly variable, and reflects the extent to which the sediment column is relatively open or closed with respect to diffusive replenishment of sulfate during bacterial sulfate reduction. Gradients in stable sulfur isotope ratios (34S/32S ) and concentration of dissolved sulfate in pore waters of marine sediments with negligible advective sulfate supply have been compiled from 42 sites of the Deep Sea Drilling Project and the Ocean Drilling Program, Legs 4 through 188.The linear sedimentation rates for the sites range from about 5 to 1500 m per million years. The apparent 34S-enrichment factors (from Rayleigh equation) vary from 4 to 72{\%} (?? = 1.004-1.072), and are directly proportional to a system "openness" parameter (i.e. the diffusive sulfate flux divided by the combined diffusive plus burial fluxes), which ranges from 0.06 to 0.87. Under conditions represented by the DSDP/ODP cores in this study, microbial sulfate reduction occurs at very slow rates with a relatively large 34S-isotopic enrichment (75{\%}). This large fractionation is diluted by variable degrees of diffusive replenishment with relatively unfractionated seawater sulfate. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Profiles of carbon isotopes were studied in marine limestones of Late Permian and Early Triassic age of the Tethyan region from 20 sections in Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Armenian SSR, Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and China. The Upper Permian sections continue the high positive values of delta13C previously found in Upper Permian basins in NW Europe and western USA. In the more complete sections of Tethys it can now be demonstrated that the values of delta13C drop from the Murgabian to the Dzhulfian Stages of the Upper Permian, then sharply to values near zero during the last two biozones of the Dorashamian. These levels of delta13C sample the Tethys Sea and the world ocean, and equal values from deep-water sediments at Salamis Greece indicate that they apply to the whole water column. We hypothesize that the high values of delta13C are a consequence of Late Paleozoic storage of organic carbon, and that the declines represent an episodic cessation of this organic deposition, and partial oxidation of the organic reservoir, extending over a period of several million years. The carbon isotope profile may reflect parallel complexity in the pattern of mass extinction in Late Permian time.},

abstract = {THE deep ocean is the storehouse for most of the carbon and nutrients in the ocean–atmosphere system; together with its out-crops at high latitudes, the deep ocean is of great importance in driving glacial–interglacial changes in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere1–3. The chemical and physical structure of the deep glacial oceans can be reconstructed by means of palaeochemical tracers; for example, the cadmium and carbon isotope contents of benthic foraminifera have been used to reconstruct the phosphate (or labile nutrient) compositions of deep waters4–14. Recently, it was proposed15 that barium in benthic foraminifera could be used to reconstruct the distribution of refractory, deep-regenerated chemical properties in the water masses of the glacial oceans. A reconstruction of barium concentra-tions in the oceans at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum revealed the greatest changes in the North Atlantic, where barium concentrations in deep water were up to 50{\%} higher than at present16. Here we present a record of the benthic Ba/Ca ratio in the deep northwest Atlantic stretching back to interglacial stage 7 ({\~{}}210 kyr ago), encompassing two full glacial cycles. A comparison of the barium record with that of the other nutrient-like tracers lends confidence in the general agreement between these tracers while showing some spectral variability unique to barium, thus underscoring its utility as an additional palaeoceanographic tracer.},

abstract = {The distributions of C31–C35 17$\alpha$,21$\beta$(H)-homohopanes in marine petroleums can be used to describe redox conditions in the source rock depositional environment. For example, high C35-homohopane indices [C35/(C31–C35)] are typical of petroleums generated from source rocks deposited under anoxic marine conditions, where the C35 backbone of the precursor bacteriohopanetetrol is preferentially preserved. Homohopane distributions have been used to distinguish petroleums from different organic facies of the same source rock. Homohopane distributions are altered by secondary processes. For example, the C35-homohopane index decreases with increasing API gravity and thermal maturity of related oils from the Monterey Formation, offshore California. Similar decreases in the homohopane index are observed for expelled oils from Monterey source rock during hydrous pyrolysis. Biodegradation can result in selective loss of high or low molecular weight homologs, apparently depending on the bacterial population in the reservoir. Bacterial demethylation of homohopanes appears necessary to explain 25-norhopanes in at least one biodegraded oil.  Hydrous pyrolysis studies of the Phosphatic and Siliceous members in the Monterey Formation show that identical heating conditions result in different homohopane C-22 epimer ratios. Furthermore, a “reversal” in the trend of the epimer ratio at high experimental temperatures is observed for the Phosphatic, but not for the Siliceous lithology. This could be caused by the combined effects of isomerization and differential thermal destruction of epimers at high temperatures, possibly mediated by rock mineralogy.},

abstract = {A single carbonate coquinoid lens from the Griesbachian (Early Triassic) of Shanggan, South China, yielded 11 bivalve species described in this study in addition to four gastropod and one ammonoid species reported elsewhere. This makes the Shanggan fauna one of the richest mollusc faunas from the early post-extinction interval after the end-Permian mass extinction event. Four of the present genera are long-term survivors, five are holdovers that went extinct at the end of the Griesbachian or later in the Early Triassic, and seven first appear in the Griesbachian. Three new bivalve species are described: Myalinella newelli nov. sp., Scythentolium scutigerulus nov. sp., and Eumorphotis shajingengi nov. sp. The genus Astartella, previously assumed to have vanished at the end of the Permian, is reported for the first time from the Early Triassic, which also removes Astartidae from Early Triassic Lazarus taxa. The small growth size of the Astartella specimens supports an earlier hypothesis that many of the Early Triassic Lazarus taxa did not survive in unknown refuges but were simply overlooked due to the scarcity of easily observable large-sized specimens. Ecologically, a comparatively high proportion of infaunal bivalve species (4/11) is remarkable for the early post-extinction interval, supporting the impression of a relatively advanced recovery state. Moreover, abundance-data of the bivalve-gastropod community reveal a remarkably low dominance index (D=0.17) that is suggestive for advanced recovery and stable environmental conditions. It is proposed that the Shanggan fauna represents a late Griesbachian benthic recovery event that coincided with the appearance of similarly diverse benthic faunas in Oman and Primorye. A high proportion of genera that have previously not been reported from the Early Triassic indicate that the prevalence of poor preservation conditions is a major obstacle in identifying early phases of recovery from the greatest crisis in the history of metazoan life. The early recovery of benthic faunas reported in this study questions previous claims of a prolonged lag phase as a consequence of the extraordinary extinction magnitude or the persistence of adverse environmental conditions.

Le genre Astartella, suppos{\'{e}} dispara{\^{i}}tre {\`{a}} la fin du Permien, est document{\'{e}} pour la premi{\`{e}}re fois dans le Trias inf{\'{e}}rieur, ce qui rend caduque l'appartenance des Astartidae aux taxons Lazares du Trias inf{\'{e}}rieur. La petite taille des sp{\'{e}}cimens d'Astartella confirme le point de vue selon lequel nombre de taxons Lazares du Trias inf{\'{e}}rieur n'ont pas surv{\'{e}}cu dans d'hypoth{\'{e}}tiques refuges mais ont simplement {\'{e}}chapp{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}chantillonnage en raison de leur petite taille. D'un point de vue {\'{e}}cologique, la relativement forte repr{\'{e}}sentation de formes infaunales parmi les bivalves (quatre esp{\`{e}}ces sur 11) est remarquable pour cette p{\'{e}}riode faisant directement suite {\`{a}} l'extinction car elle correspondrait {\`{a}} un stade de r{\'{e}}cup{\'{e}}ration relativement avanc{\'{e}}.

abstract = {The end of Permian time (252-251Ma) hosts the largest mass extinction in Earth history, yet events heralding this global catastrophe remain intensely disputed. We present a chemostratigraphic marker, the 187Re/188Os ratio, which soars to unprecedented levels approaching the Permo-Triassic boundary. These ratios are tied to profound trace element changes and a precise Re-Os time record at 252Ma preserved in black shales from East Greenland and the mid-Norwegian shelf. Within a 36-meter shale section, an 80-fold increase in Re concentrations (two-fold for Os) signals seawater conditions that became increasingly inhospitable to life. Unwavering initial 187Os/188Os ratios of 0.6 preclude mafic volcanism and meteorite impact as the direct cause of Late Permian anoxia. We argue that extraordinarily high 187Re/188Os ratios are the hallmark of simultaneously rising ocean temperature and acidity, leading to loss of oxygen and the stifling of life in latest Permian time. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB, {\~{}}252.3Ma) marks the largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic, with a loss of more than 90{\%} of marine organisms, and is characterized by lethally hot surface temperatures. The PTB global warming has been linked to greenhouse gas emissions from the Siberian Traps and associated coal-bed intrusions and likely led to severe environmental consequences, such as ocean acidification, a decline in the marine productivity, and extensive hypoxia. In order to understand these changes, feedbacks in the climate system have been explored with sensitivity climate simulations and compared to temperature proxies from the sedimentary record. The response of the PTB ocean circulation to an atmospheric perturbation of {\~{}}5000PgC, comparable to Earth's total fossil fuel inventory, leads to a global temperature increase by 3-4°C and an increase in ocean stratification. The pole-to-equator temperature gradient decreases by 2°C with an increase in CO2-radiative forcing, predominately due to snow albedo feedbacks over Gondwana. The greenhouse-induced warming would have led to a weakening of the Hadley cell and an associated decrease in the trade winds and equatorial primary productivity. These climatic changes might have been amplified by cloud-feedback processes. A reduced concentration of cloud condensation nuclei due to a biologic decline of dimethylsulfide caused by the temperature stress or changes in airborne mineral particles could have reduced the cloud albedo, particularly in high latitudes. Results from a climate simulation with reduced cloud albedo suggest a polar warming of up to 7°C and a reduction of the pole-to-equator temperature gradient by {\~{}}4°C in addition to the reduction caused by the increase in greenhouse-induced radiative forcing. The scenario with reduced cloud albedo further leads to an increase in ocean stratification and widespread low-oxygen concentrations in the Panthalassa during the Early Triassic.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic mass extinction was the most severe biotic crisis in the past 500 million years. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the crisis, but few account for the spectrum of extinction selectivity and subsequent recovery. Here we show that selective losses are best accounted for by a combination of lethally warm, shallow waters and anoxic deep waters that acted to severely restrict the habitable area to a narrow mid-water refuge zone. The relative tolerance of groups to this double whammy provides the first clear explanation for the selective extinction losses during this double-pulsed crisis and also the fitful recovery. Thus, high temperature intolerant shallow-water dwellers, such as corals, large foraminifers and radiolarians were eliminated first whilst high temperature tolerant ostracods thrived except in anoxic deeper-waters. In contrast, hypoxia tolerant but temperature intolerant small foraminifers were driven from shallow-waters but thrived on dysoxic slopes margins. Only those mollusc groups, which are tolerant of both hypoxia and high temperatures, were able to thrive in the immediate aftermath of the extinction. Limited Early Triassic benthic recovery was restricted to mid-water depths and coincided with intervals of cooling and deepening of water column anoxia that expanded the habitable mid-water refuge zone.},

abstract = {The Phanerozoic fossil record of marine animal diversity covaries with the amount of marine sedimentary rock. The extent to which this covariation reflects a geologically controlled sampling bias remains unknown. We show that Phanerozoic records of seawater chemistry and continental flooding contain information on the diversity of marine animals that is independent of sedimentary rock quantity and sampling. Interrelationships among variables suggest long-term interactions among continental flooding, sulfur and carbon cycling, and macroevolution. Thus, mutual responses to interacting Earth systems, not sampling biases, explain much of the observed covariation between Phanerozoic patterns of sedimentation and fossil biodiversity. Linkages between biodiversity and environmental records likely reflect complex biotic responses to changing ocean redox conditions and long-term sea-level fluctuations driven by plate tectonics.},

abstract = {Marine carbonate precipitation occurs in three basic modes: abiotic (or quasi-abiotic), biotically induced, and biotically controlled. On a geologic scale, these precipitation modes combine to form three carbonate production systems, or "factories" in the benthic environment: (1) tropical shallow-water factory, dominated by biotically controlled (mainly photo-autotrophic) and abiotic precipitates; (2) cool-water factory, dominated by biotically controlled (mainly heterotrophic) precipitates; and (3) mud-mound factory, dominated by biotically induced (mainly microbial) and abiotic precipitates. Sediment accumulations of the factories differ in composition, geometry, and facies patterns, and some of these differences appear prominently in seismic data, thus facilitating subsurface prediction. The characteristic accumulation of the tropical factory is the flat-topped, often reef-rimmed platform. In cool-water systems, reefs in high-energy settings are scarce and hydrodynamic influence dominates, producing seaward-sloping shelves and deep-water sediment drifts often armored by skeletal framework. The typical accumulation of the mud-mound factory is groups of mounds in deeper water. Where the mud-mound factory expands into shallow water, it forms rimmed platforms similar to the tropical factory. The tropical factory is most productive; the mud-mound factory reaches 80-90{\%}, and the cool-water factory 20-30{\%} of the tropical growth rate. The three factories represent end members connected by transitions in space. Transitions in time are linked to biotic evolution.},

abstract = {Fabric and pyrite framboid size analysis of Permian to Jurassic samples from the Mino-Tamba terrane of Japan provide an 80 myr redox history from the Panthalassa Ocean. Fully oxygenated conditions dominated but were punctuated by three phases of anoxia (euxinia) during the Permo-Triassic boundary, the late Early Triassic (Spathian Stage) and the late Early Jurassic (Toarcian Stage). A Permo-Triassic superanoxic event of 10 myr duration is thus resolved into a complex redox history of dysoxic-anoxic background conditions punctuated by short-lived euxinic pulses. Both the end-Permian and Toarcian anoxic episodes began abruptly with the development of siliceous claystones, characterized by a framboid-dominated pyrite fraction and no organic C enrichment, interpreted to record euxinic conditions. These facies are overlain by organic-rich shales with slightly larger framboids, more crystalline pyrite and bioturbation indicating accumulation beneath a better-ventilated, higher productivity water column. Thus, an initial phase of ocean-wide stagnation was followed by improved circulation attributed to the onset of warm saline bottom water circulation. Five radiolarian crises during our study interval show a complex relationship with redox conditions. The latest Permian mass extinction coincided with the onset of ocean euxinia but two other crises (Middle Permian and end Triassic), occurred during fully oxygenated intervals. Radiolarian radiation events are also not consistently linked with redox conditions: diversification in the early Late Permian coincides with the onset of weakly dysoxic conditions, late Early Triassic and late Early Jurassic radiations coincide with euxinic events, and the basal Jurassic radiation occurred during a fully oxic phase. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most shallow marine sections described from the Lower Triassic formed in mixed carbonate-siliciclastic systems. Shallow marine limestones from an isolated carbonate platform, the Great Bank of Guizhou, in the Nanpanjiang Basin, South China, provide a unique opportunity to examine a pure peritidal carbonate depositional system. The platform had a low-relief bank profile in the Early Triassic with oolite shoals at the margin, shallow-subtidal and peritidal deposits in the interior, and pelagics, debris-flow deposits and turbidites on gentle basin-margin slopes. Interior strata are 265 m thick beginning in the lowermost Triassic with Renalcis biostromes, followed by lime mudstone, oolite, and cyclic peritidal limestone. The cyclic limestone is Olenekian in age, 164 m thick, and contains up to 83 cycles (parasequences). Parasequences are 0.2-7.4 m thick and typically shallow upward from subtidal oolite grainstone and skeletal packstone facies followed by Renalcis reef mounds or biostromes and capped by intertidal flaser-bedded ribbon rock. The skeletal packstone and reef mounds contain a low-diversity biota of cyanobacteria, echinoderms, bivalves, gastropods, lingulid brachiopods, spirorbids, and ostracodes. Ribbon rock contains alternating lime mud and fine peloidal packstone and grainstone laminae, scour surfaces, ripple cross lamination, lime-mud drapes, and minor prism cracks. Parasequence stacking patterns exhibit gradual increase and decrease of parasequence thickness, defining a third-order sequence boundary and several 4th-order parasequence sets that correlate between interior sections. Parasequence stacking patterns similar to those of Lower Palaeozoic green-house sequences and different from ice-house sequences. The Lower Triassic platform-interior parasequences represent an anachronistic facies in that they are strikingly similar to the common Renalcis-mound, ribbon rock parasequences of the Lower Palaeozoic and different from other Permo-Triassic parasequences (e.g. Capitan shelf parasequences or Loferites). Facies similarities such as Renalcis mounds and flaser-bedded intertidal ribbon rock reflect anomalous oceanic conditions resulting in low biodiversity and low intensity of bioturbation after the end-Permian extinction. Similarities in parasequence stacking patterns reflect low-amplitude, high-frequency sea-level fluctuations resulting from green-house conditions common to the Early Palaeozoic and Early Triassic. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {An abrupt transition from oxic to anoxic-sulfidic (euxinic) marine bottom waters occurred in the Cariaco Basin in response to increasing productivity resulting from the late Pleistocene post-glacial rise in sea level and corresponding increase in surface-water nutrient availability. The microlaminated sediments of the euxinic interval, which span the last ???14.5 ky, suggest a predominance of water-column (syngenetic) pyrite formation based on (1) high pyrite sulfur (Spy) concentrations in the surficial sediment layers, (2) values for degree-of-pyritization (DOP) that generally do not increase appreciably with increasing burial, (3) ratios of total iron (FeT) to Al that are elevated above the continental baseline recorded in the underlying oxic sediments, and (4) Spy isotope trends that largely mimic the ??34SHS- of the modern water column. Intermediate DOP values in the microlaminated deposits and FeT/Al ratios that are slightly above continental levels indicate an iron reservoir controlled by scavenging during syngenetic pyrite formation in combination with intermediate rates of Fe-bearing siliciclastic accumulation. As predicted from the relative rates of siliciclastic delivery, FeT/Al and DOP data lie between end-member values observed in the modern Black Sea. As viewed broadly, FeT/Al and DOP relationships in euxinic sediments reflect the balance between syngenetic Fe scavenging and temporal and spatial gradients in siliciclastic input. Pyrite concentrations are generally low in the underlying oxic marine deposits because of limitations in the supply of organic carbon (Corg). However, the upper 80 cm of the Fe-rich, Corg-poor, bioturbated sediment show evidence for a strong diffusional HS- overprint from the overlying, Fe-limited euxinic marine environment. This post-glacial transition manifests in pyrite overprints that are strongly 34S-depleted relative to those in restricted, presently euxinic marine settings elsewhere in the world, such as the Black Sea, where the sedimentary sequence spanning the last glacial-interglacial transition begins with a shift from freshwater to Corg-poor oxic marine deposition and thus dominantly sulfate diffusion. Trends for Mo/Al ratios in the microlaminated sediments suggest that Mo is enriched by roughly two orders of magnitude above the continental levels recorded in the oxic deposits. Organic matter plays a role by enhancing HS- production and/or by providing a substrate for Mo scavenging. Significant Mo enrichment via diffusion into the upper portion of the bioturbated zone was not observed despite HS--rich pore waters as recorded in the heavy iron sulfide overprint. We have not, however, proven that high sulfide concentrations within the water column are required for enhanced Mo sequestration in sediments. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The recrystallisation (dissolution-precipitation) of carbonate sediments has been successfully modelled to explain profiles of pore water Sr concentration and radiogenic Sr isotope composition at different locations of the global ocean. However, there have been few systematic studies trying to better understand the relative importance of factors influencing the variability of carbonate recrystallisation. Here we present results from a multi-component study of recrystallisation in sediments from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 320/321 Pacific Equatorial Age Transect (PEAT), where sediments of similar initial composition have been subjected to different diagenetic histories. The PEAT sites investigated exhibit variable pore water Sr concentrations gradients with the largest gradients in the youngest sites. Radiogenic Sr isotopes suggest recrystallisation was relative rapid, consistent with modelling of other sediment columns, as the 87Sr/86Sr ratios are indistinguishable (within 2?? uncertainties) from contemporaneous seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Bulk carbonate leachates and associated pore waters of Site U1336 have lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios than contemporaneous seawater in sediments older than 20.2Ma most likely resulting from the upward diffusion of Sr from older recrystallised carbonates. It seems that recrystallisation at Site U1336 may still be on-going at depths below 102.5rmcd (revised metres composite depth) suggesting a late phase of recrystallisation. Furthermore, the lower Sr/Ca ratios of bulk carbonates of Site U1336 compared to the other PEAT sites suggest more extensive diagenetic alteration as less Sr is incorporated into secondary calcite. Compared to the other PEAT sites, U1336 has an inferred greater thermal gradient and a higher carbonate content. The enhanced thermal gradient seems to have made these sediments more reactive and enhanced recrystallisation. In this study we investigate stable Sr isotopes from carbonate-rich deep sea sediments for the first time. Pore water ??88/86Sr increases with depth (from 0.428??? to values reaching up to 0.700???) at Site U1336 documenting an isotope fractionation process during recrystallisation. Secondary calcite preferentially incorporates the lighter Sr isotope (86Sr) leaving pore waters isotopically heavy. The ??88/86Sr values of the carbonates themselves show more uniform values with no detectable change with depth. Carbonates have a much higher Sr content and total Sr inventory than the pore waters meaning pore waters are much more sensitive to fractionation processes than the carbonates. The ??88/86Sr results indicate that pore water stable Sr isotopes have the potential to indicate the recrystallisation of carbonate sediments.},

abstract = {The middle of the Cretaceous (120–80 Ma) was one of the warmest periods of the past 300 m.y., with tropical sea-surface temperatures well over 30 °C (Puc{\'{e}}at et al., 2007; Forster et al., 2007a) and atmospheric CO2 levels much higher than today. Therefore this period can give us crucial information on the mechanisms governing the climatic system in a context of extreme greenhouse conditions. Within this interval, major perturbations of the carbon cycle occurred around the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (93.5 Ma), evidenced by worldwide deposition of organic-rich (black) shales in the oceans, and a large positive carbon isotope excursion reflecting enhanced burial of 13C-depleted organic carbon. Such episodes of extensive organic-matter burial are known as oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) and are thought to have an impact on global climate through atmospheric CO2 draw-down (Forster et al., 2007b). Both increased primary productivity leading to higher fluxes of organic carbon to the seafloor, and better preservation of organic matter due to anoxic conditions have been invoked to explain enhanced organic-matter burial (Arthur et al., 1990). Although sluggish ocean circulation is often called upon to explain widespread ocean anoxia, we actually know very little about the global circulation system during the Cretaceous. Apart from numerical simulations, few studies treat paleocirculation, and existing data on ocean structure remain very scarce for this period (Barrera et al., 1997; Puc{\'{e}}at et al., 2005; Soudry et al., 2006). In this issue of Geology, MacLeod et al. (p. 811–814) present new paleoceanographic data based on neodymium isotopes for the Late Cretaceous period, and they track circulation changes in the southern North Atlantic across the oceanic anoxic event of the Cenomanian-Turonian (OAE2), one of the most prominent OAEs.},

abstract = {Patterns of taxonomic and ecologic selectivity are the most direct record of processes influencing survival during background and mass extinctions. The Guadalupian (Capitanian) and end-Permian (Changhsingian) extinctions have both been linked to environmental degradation from eruption of large flood basalts; however, the extent to which taxonomic selectivity conforms to the expected stresses remains incompletely understood because many of the relevant biological traits are mutually correlated. Here we use a large occurrence-based database to quantify extinction selectivity during background and mass extinction intervals from the Kungurian (latest Early Permian) to Changhsingian. Our multiple logistic regression analysis confirms that the end-Permian extinction was a physiological crisis, selecting against genera with poorly buffered respiratory physiology and calcareous shells. Genera with unbuffered physiology also fared poorly in the Guadalupian extinction, consistent with recognition of a pronounced crisis only among protists and reef-builders and implying similar respiratory physiological stresses. Despite sharing a similar trigger, the end-Permian extinction was considerably more severe than the Guadalupian or other Phanerozoic physiological crises. Its magnitude may have resulted from a larger environmental perturbation, although the combination of warming, hypercapnia, ocean acidification, and hypoxia during the end-Permian extinction likely exacerbated the crisis because of the multiplicative effects of those stresses. Although ocean carbon cycle and evolutionary changes have reduced the sensitivity of modern ecosystems to physiological stresses, extant marine invertebrates face the same synergistic effects of multiple stressors that were so severe during the end-Permian extinction.},

Variations in the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of limestones, produced during early freshwater diagenesis, have been observed in this study to occur in specific patterns. Six potentially useful patterns emerge when viewing stable isotope data within a stratigraphic framework. Analysis of samples from five Palaeozoic and Mesozoic formations, which contained petrographic evidence of early freshwater diagenesis, showed that isotope patterns similar to those observed in Barbados limestones have been preserved in rocks as old as Mississippian. These isotope patterns could prove useful for identifying diagenetically induced porosity trends in carbonate rocks: to identify limestones diagenetically altered in meteoric environments, to identify mixing zone cements and dolomites, and to trace the regional and vertical distributions of early meteoric groundwater systems in ancient carbonate formations.-from AuthorsDept of Geol Sci, Brown Univ, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA.},

A significant group of conodont workers have proposed or accepted a craniate designation for the conodont animal, an interpretation that is increasingly becoming established as accepted “fact”. Against this prevailing trend, our conclusion is based on a revised analysis of traditional morphological features of both discrete conodont elements and apparatuses, histological investigation and a revised cladistic analysis modifying that used in the keystone publication promoted as proof of the hypothesis that conodonts are vertebrates. Our study suggests that conodonts possibly were not even chordates but demonstration of this is beyond the scope of this paper. To summarize, in conodonts there is low cephalization; presence of simple V-shaped trunk musculature and unique large-crystal albid material in the elements; lack of a dermal skeleton including characteristic vertebrate hard tissues of bone, dentine and enamel; lack of odontodes with bone of attachment and a unique pulp system; lack of segmentally-arranged paraxial elements and dermal elements in median fins, all of which supports neither a vertebrate nor a craniate relationship for conodonts.},

abstract = {Reactions between reduced inorganic sulfur and organic compounds are thought to be important for the preservation of organic matter (OM) in sediments, but the sulfurization process is poorly understood. Sulfur isotopes are potentially useful tracers of sulfurization reactions, which often occur in the presence of a strong porewater isotopic gradient driven by microbial sulfate reduction. Prior studies of bulk sedimentary OM indicate that sulfurized products are 34S-enriched relative to coexisting sulfide, and experiments have produced 34S-enriched organosulfur compounds. However, analytical limitations have prevented the relationship from being tested at the molecular level in natural environments. Here we apply a new method, coupled gas chromatography - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, to measure the compound-specific sulfur isotopic compositions of volatile organosulfur compounds over a 6m core of anoxic Cariaco Basin sediments. In contrast to current conceptual models, nearly all extractable organosulfur compounds were substantially depleted in 34S relative to coexisting kerogen and porewater sulfide. We hypothesize that this 34S depletion is due to a normal kinetic isotope effect during the initial formation of a carbon-sulfur bond and that the source of sulfur in this relatively irreversible reaction is most likely the bisulfide anion in sedimentary porewater. The 34S-depleted products of irreversible bisulfide addition alone cannot explain the isotopic composition of total extractable or residual OM. Therefore, at least two different sulfurization pathways must operate in the Cariaco Basin, generating isotopically distinct products. Compound-specific sulfur isotope analysis thus provides new insights into the timescales and mechanisms of OM sulfurization.},

Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters.

This reveals that Hindeodus increased and Clarkina sharply declined in abundance during a phase of relative sea-level rise which began at the end-Permian (Bed 25) and extended into Early Triassic. This was associated with the development of anoxic conditions. This distribution does not accord with previous suggestions that Hindeodus was a nearshore, shallow water taxon. The decline of the supposed deeper water genus Clarkina is also somewhat surprising but it may relate to the inhibition of a nektobenthic genus by dysoxic-anoxic bottom waters. The widespread facies and geographic distribution of Hindeodus suggests it was a pelagic type unaffected by anoxic bottom waters. Hence, the Hindeodus lineage provides a reliable criterion for identification of the Permian-Triassic boundary. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights: reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract – The intensity and extent of anoxia during the two Kellwasser anoxic events has been
investigated in a range of European localities using amultidisciplinary approach (pyrite framboid assay,
gamma-ray spectrometry and sediment fabric analysis). The results reveal that the development of the
Lower Kellwasser Horizon in the early Late rhenana Zone (Frasnian Stage) in German type sections
does not always coincide with anoxic events elsewhere in Europe and, in some locations, seafloor
oxygenation improves during this interval. Thus, this anoxic event is not universally developed. In
contrast, the Upper Kellwasser Horizon, developed in the Late linguiformis Zone (Frasnian Stage) in
Germany correlates with a European-wide anoxic event that is manifest as an intensification of anoxia
in basinal locations to the point that stable euxinic conditionswere developed (for example, in the basins
of the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland). The interval also saw the spread of dysoxic waters into very
shallow water (for instance, reefal) locations, and it seems reasonable to link the contemporaneous
demise of many marine taxa to this phase of intense and widespread anoxia. In basinal locations,
euxinic conditions persisted into the earliest Famennian with little change of depositional conditions.
Only in the continental margin location of Austria was anoxia not developed at any time in the Late
Devonian. Consequently it appears that the Upper Kellwasser anoxic event was an epicontinental
seaway phenomenon, caused by the upward expansion of anoxia from deep basinal locales rather than
an ‘oceanic' anoxic event that has spilled laterally into epicontinental settings.},

Fractionation is influenced by all steps in the dissimilatory pathway, which means that environmental sulfate and sulfide levels control sulfur isotope fractionation through the proximate influence of intracellular metabolites. Although sulfur isotope fractionation is a phenotypic trait that appears to be strain specific, we show that it converges on near-thermodynamic behavior, even at micromolar sulfate levels, as long as intracellular sulfate reduction rates are low enough ({\textless}1 fmol H2S⋅cell(-1)⋅d(-1)).},

abstract = {Transient pore-water and solid-phase signatures in deep subseafloor marine sediments, resulting from changes in both the amount and the quality of the organic matter input, are common but often difficult to interpret. We combined high-resolution pore-water and solid-phase data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323 Site U1341 (Bowers Ridge, Bering Sea) with inverse reaction-transport modeling to examine the evolution and potential preservation of diagenetic signals in these deep subseafloor sediments. We explore how these signals reflect major changes in the deposition and reactivity of organic matter to the seafloor at Bowers Ridge. Results of the inverse model approach reveal that 2.51-2.58. Ma ago a high deposition flux of extremely labile organic matter, probably linked to increased surface water primary productivity, affected this site. Associated elevated organoclastic sulfate reduction rates facilitated low sulfate concentrations, the onset of methanogenesis, and consequently sulfate reduction coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Sulfate depletion caused the dissolution of biogenic barite reflected by a sedimentary interval with low Ba/Al ratios. Two sulfate-methane transition zones (SMTZs) evolved where high rates of AOM controlled sulfate consumption which was sustained by the influx of sulfate from seawater above and a deep source below. The positions of both SMTZs shifted non-synchronously over the subsequent ∼130,000. yrs, until methanogenesis and AOM declined. The present-day sulfate concentration and sulfur isotope profiles still reflect the impact of the reactive organic matter pulse. They also record a period of very low reactive organic matter deposition during the middle to late Pleistocene, probably linked to very low primary productivity, resulting in little microbial carbon turnover in the sediment. Our study shows that combining biogeochemical signatures recorded in the solid-phase of deep subseafloor sediments with the analysis of transient pore-water signals by inverse reaction-transport modeling yields new insights into past deep biosphere processes and the paleoproductivity of marine basins. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Anthropogenic rise in the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere leads to global warming and acidification of the oceans. Ocean acidification (OA) is harmful to many organisms but especially to those that build massive skeletons of calcium carbonate, such as reef corals. Here, we test the recent suggestion that OA leads not only to declining calcification of reef corals and reduced growth rates of reefs but may also have been a trigger of ancient reef crises and mass extinctions in the sea. We analyse the fossil record of biogenic reefs and marine organisms to (1) assess the timing and intensity of ancient reef crises, (2) check which reef crises were concurrent with inferred pulses of carbon dioxide concentrations and (3) evaluate the correlation between reef crises and mass extinctions and their selectivity in terms of inferred physiological buffering. We conclude that four of five global metazoan reef crises in the last 500 Myr were probably at least partially governed by OA and rapid global warming. However, only two of the big five mass extinctions show geological evidence of OA.},

abstract = {The Khunamuh Formation of the Guryul Ravine section in Kashmir provides one of the most detailed deep-water records of the end-Permian mass extinction in Perigondwanan palaeolatitudes. Examination of pyrite framboid size distributions and sediment microfabric reveals a distinct change in the uppermost Permian strata from nonlaminated, pyrite-free silty mudstones to finely laminated, silty shales rich in framboidal pyrite around 1 m above the base of the formation. The size frequency distribution of the framboids is identical to populations from severely oxygen-restricted modern depositional environments. This change to dysoxic benthic conditions coincides with the rapid demise of diverse Permian brachiopod and bryozoan assemblages. Thus, the link between extinction and anoxia is clearly seen at Guryul Ravine and it provides an interesting contrast to other Perigondwanan sections developed in shallower water where both the onset of anoxia and the extinction occurred somewhat later in the earliest Triassic.},

This evolution includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic processes on time scales of 10(5) to 10(7) years, rhythmic or periodic cycles driven by orbital processes with 10(4)- to 10(6)-year cyclicity, and rare rapid aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 10(3) to 10(5) years. Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate.},

abstract = {Fossil record of Phanerozoic non-spicular sponges, beside of being important with respect to the lineage evolution per se, could provide valuable references for the investigation of Precambrian ancestral animal fossils. However, although modern phylogenomic studies resolve non-spicular demosponges as the sister group of the remaining spiculate demosponges, the fossil record of the former is extremely sparse or unexplored compared to that of the latter; the Middle Cambrian Vauxiidae Walcott 1920, is the only confirmed fossil taxon of non-spicular demosponges. Here, we describe carbonate materials from Devonian (Upper Givetian to Lower Frasnian) bioherms of northern France and Triassic (Anisian) microbialites of Poland that most likely represent fossil remnants of keratose demosponges. These putative fossils of keratose demosponges are preserved as automicritic clumps. They are morphologically distinguishable from microbial fabrics but similar to other spiculate sponge fossils, except that the skeletal elements consist of fibrous networks instead of assembled spicules. Consistent with the immunological behavior of sponges, these fibrous skeletons often form a rim at the edge of the automicritic aggregate, separating the inner part of the aggregate from foreign objects. To confirm the architecture of these fibrous networks, two fossil specimens and a modern thorectid sponge for comparison were processed for three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction using serial grinding tomography. The resulting fossil reconstructions are three-dimensionally anastomosing, like modern keratose demosponges, but their irregular and nonhierarchical meshes indicate a likely verongid affinity, although a precise taxonomic conclusion cannot be made based on the skeletal architecture alone. This study is a preliminary effort, but an important start to identify fossil non-spicular demosponges in carbonates and to re-evaluate their fossilization potential.},

abstract = {The 87Sr/86Sr ratios and Sr concentrations in sediment and pore fluids are used to evaluate the rates of calcite recrystallization at ODP Site 807A on the Ontong Java Plateau, an 800-meter thick section of carbonate ooze and chalk. A numerical model is used to evaluate the pore fluid chemistry and Sr isotopes in an accumulating section. The deduced calcite recrystallization rate is 2{\%} per million years ({\%}/Myr) near the top of the section and decreases systematically in older parts of the section such that the rate is close to 0.1/age (in years). The deduced recrystallization rates have important implications for the interpretation of Ca and Mg concentration profiles in the pore fluids. The effect of calcite recrystallization on pore fluid chemistry is described by the reaction length, L, which varies by element, and depends on the concentration in pore fluid and solid. When L is small compared to the thickness of the sedimentary section, the pore fluid concentration is controlled by equilibrium or steady-state exchange with the solid phase, except within a distance L of the sediment-water interface. When L is large relative to the thickness of sediment, the pore fluid concentration is mostly controlled by the boundary conditions and diffusion. The values of L for Ca, Sr, and Mg are of order 15, 150, and 1500 meters, respectively. LSr is derived from isotopic data and modeling, and allows us to infer the values of LCa and LMg. The small value for LCa indicates that pore fluid Ca concentrations, which gradually increase down section, must be equilibrium values that are maintained by solution-precipitation exchange with calcite and do not reflect Ca sources within or below the sediment column. The pore fluid Ca measurements and measured alkalinity allow us to calculate the in situ pH in the pore fluids, which decreases from 7.6 near the sediment-water interface to 7.1 ?? 0.1 at 400-800 mbsf. While the calculated pH values are in agreement with some of the values measured during ODP Leg 130, most of the measurements are artifacts. The large value for LMg indicates that the pore fluid Mg concentrations at 807A are not controlled by calcite-fluid equilibrium but instead are determined by the changing Mg concentration of seawater during deposition, modified by aqueous diffusion in the pore fluids. We use the pore fluid Mg concentration profile at Site 807A to retrieve a global record for seawater Mg over the past 35 Myr, which shows that seawater Mg has increased rapidly over the past 10 Myr, rather than gradually over the past 60 Myr. This observation suggests that the Cenozoic rise in seawater Mg is controlled by continental weathering inputs rather than by exchange with oceanic crust. The relationship determined between reaction rate and age in silicates and carbonates is strikingly similar, which suggests that reaction affinity is not the primary determinant of silicate dissolution rates in nature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The cores contain significant contents of organic matter comprising kerogen and bitumen of low to moderate thermal maturity. Extraction and analysis of the bitumens has revealed pat- terns of biomarker hydrocarbons consistent with marine deposition and photic zone euxinia. In particular isorenieratane and aryl isoprenoids, derived from the carotenoid pigments of green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae), are abundant and pervasive throughout the section and indicate that hydrogen sulfide must have been present in the photic zone for significant periods of time. These findings mirror the geochemical results obtained for other Permian–Triassic boundary sections of the Tethys realm (e.g. Western Australia, East Greenland and South China) and suggest that euxinic conditions prevailed widely, though perhaps periodically, and that hydrogen sulfide toxicity could have been an important factor in the extinction of marine invertebrates.},

abstract = {Fluxes of dissolved nutrients in the organic-rich sediment of Makirina Bay (Croatia) were estimated in in-situ incubation experiments and compared to those calculated from a diagenetic model based on the concentration vs. depth profiles in the pore water extracted from a sediment core at the same sampling site. Benthic fluxes observed in the in-situ experiment were strongly influenced by the decomposition of sedimentary organic matter by bacterial sulfate reduction and precipitation of authigenic pyrite and calcite. Assimilation of dissolved nitrate and ammonia within the sediment resulted in peculiar nitrate and ammonia concentration profiles. Differences between the benthic and diffusive fluxes indicated that the effects of bioturbation and irrigation, which were not taken into account in the model calculation of diffusive fluxes, should not be considered as negligible. They are, however, extremely difficult to estimate because of the heterogeneity of the sediment. Sulfate reduction in the pore water could not be detected, although it was obvious from pyrite precipitation and the isotopic compositions of different sedimentary sulfur species. It is suggested that reoxidation of sulfide and upward diffusion of sulfate from the sediment layer accumulated during past salt production can account for the scattered sulfate vs. depth profile. The distribution and stable isotope compositions of sedimentary sulfur species were studied in more detail. The influx of sulfate was explained by rapid sulfate reduction in the sediment. The sulfate reduction rate was highest in the upper part of the sediment column, as concluded from $\delta$34S values. In lower horizons, the concentration of organic sulfur increased, while concentrations of sulfide decreased. The mirror-imaged concentration vs. depth profiles of sulfide and organic sulfur, as well as their stable isotopic compositions, show that they were formed simultaneously, most probably in competitive processes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Equations are developed for the calculation of the simultaneous variations in trace element concentrations and radiogenic and stable isotopic compositions that occur during water-rock interaction. The equations are of general use for modeling chemical and isotopic variations in porous media and are applied here to the diagenesis of carbonate rocks and sediments. The variables which control the ultimate geochemical composition of diagenetic carbonates include the composition of the original sediment and fluid, water:rock ratio, fractionation factors, distribution coefficients, open vs. closed system behavior, and porosity. Owing to the extreme differences in the concentrations of oxygen and carbon in diagenetic fluids, carbonate minerals equilibrate with fluid $\delta$ 18O values at three orders of magnitude lower water:rock ratios ({\textless}10) than the water:rock ratios at which they equilibrate with fluid $\delta$13C values ( 103). 87Sr86Sr ratios are affected at variable rates. In order to reset the 87Sr86Sr value of a marine limestone during freshwater diagenesis, water:rock ratios similar to those calculated for equilibration of $\delta$13C values are required, while Sr-Ca-rich brines can reset the 87Sr86Sr value of a limestone at low water:rock ratios, similar to those calculated for equilibration of $\delta$18O values. Water:rock ratios exceeding 103 are required to affect the rare earth element (REE) patterns and Nd isotopic compositions of carbonate sediments during diagenesis. These large, relative differences in the response of different isotopic systems to water-rock interaction translate into characteristic trends on isotope and trace element covariation diagrams that can be used to distinguish between ( 1 ) different models for water-rock interaction and (2) different processes such as water-rock interaction, mixing of fluids, and mixing of mineral endmembers. An example is the use of simultaneous variations of O and Sr isotopes in modeling the freshwater diagenesis of limestones. Fresh-water-limestone interaction pathways are independent of Sr-Ca exchange distribution coefficient (KSr-CaD) values over an order of magnitude range of 0.01 to 0.15, because of the large differences in the water:rock ratios necessary to equilibrate the two isotopic systems. Carbon vs. oxygen isotopic variations in the same system can be used to distinguish between water-rock interaction, mixing of fluids, and mixing of end-member calcites. These modeling approaches are applied to the regionally extensive dolomites of the Mississippian Burlington-Keokuk Formation. Compared to its early dolomite precursor (dolomite I), second-generation replacement dolomite (II) in the Burlington-Keokuk Formation has higher 87Sr86Sr ratios, lower $\delta$18O values and Sr concentrations, and similar $\delta$13C values, Nd isotopic compositions, and REE patterns. A multistage model calculation can account for the dolomite II data via recrystallization of dolomite I, whereby the $\delta$18O values of dolomite II record a relatively minor and late portion of the water-rock interaction history of the samples while Sr in the dolomites preserves an earlier and larger segment of the same history. The recrystallization process was effected by extraformational brines in a relatively open system with respect to Sr, while C and the REE were unaffected.},

abstract = {We developed a plate tectonic model for the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (Ordovician to Cretaceous) integrating dynamic plate boundaries, plate buoyancy, ocean spreading rates and major tectonic and magmatic events. Plates were constructed through time by adding/removing oceanic material, symbolized by synthetic isochrons, to major continents and terranes. Driving forces like slab pull and slab buoyancy were used to constrain the evolution of paleo-oceanic domains. This approach offers good control of sea-floor spreading and plate kinematics. This new method represents a distinct departure from classical continental drift reconstructions, which are not constrained, due to the lack of plate boundaries. This model allows a more comprehensive analysis of the development of the Tethyan realm in space and time. In particular, the relationship between the Variscan and the Cimmerian cycles in the Mediterranean-Alpine realm is clearly illustrated by numerous maps. For the Alpine cycle, the relationship between the Alpides senso stricto and the Tethysides is also explicable in terms of plate tectonic development of the Alpine Tethys-Atlantic domain versus the NeoTethys domain.},

We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite upwelling onto large portions of the continental shelf, reaching depths of approximately 40 to 120 meters along most transect lines and all the way to the surface on one transect off northern California. Although seasonal upwelling of the undersaturated waters onto the shelf is a natural phenomenon in this region, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area.},

The flux of iron is found to exceed both the oxygen and the sulfide fluxes.  Because of the insolubility of iron oxides and sulfides the implication is that dissolved iron was fairly abundant and that oxygen and sulfide were rare in the atmosphere and ocean.  Sulfate, produced by the oxidation of volcanogenic sulfur gases, was the most abundant sulfur species in the ocean, but its concentration was low by modern standards because of the absence of the river-borne flux of dissolved sulfate produced by oxidative weathering of the continents.  These findings are consistent with the geologic record of the isotopic composition of sedimentary sulfates and sulfides.  Except in restricted environments, the sulfur metabolism of the earliest organisms probably involved oxidized sulfur species not sulfide.},

abstract = {The evolution of complex life over the past 600 million years was disrupted by at least five mass extinctions, one of which occurred at the close of the Triassic period. The end-Triassic extinction corresponds to a period of high atmospheric-CO2 concentrations caused by massive volcanism and biomass burning; most extinction scenarios invoke the resulting environmental perturbations in accounting for the loss of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Here we reconstruct changes in Tethyan shallow marine ecosystems and ocean redox chemistry from earliest Jurassic (Hettangian)-aged black shales from Germany and Luxemburg. The shales contain increased concentrations of the biomarker isorenieratane, a fossilized pigment from green sulphur bacteria. The abundance of green sulphur bacteria suggests that the photic zone underwent prolonged periods of high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide. This interval is also marked by the proliferation of green algae, an indicator of anoxia. We conclude that the redox changes in the entire water column reflect sluggish circulation in marginal regions of the Tethys Ocean. We suggest that the resultant repeated poisoning of shallow epicontinental seas—hotspots of Mesozoic biodiversity—with hydrogen sulphide may have slowed the recovery of marine ecosystems during the Early Jurassic.$\backslash$nView full text},

abstract = {As recognized already by Charles Darwin, animals are geobiological agents. Darwin observed that worms aerate and mix soils on a massive scale, aiding in the decomposition of soil organic matter. A similar statement can be made about marine benthic animals. This mixing, also known as bioturbation, not only aides in the decomposition of sedimentary organic material, but as contended here, it has also significantly influenced the chemistry of seawater. In particular, it is proposed that sediment mixing by bioturbating organisms resulted in a severalfold increase in seawater sulfate concentration. For this reason, the evolution of bioturbation is linked to the significant deposition of sulfate evaporate minerals, which is largely a phenomena of the Phanerozoic, the last 542 million years and the time over which animals rose to prominence.},

abstract = {The 'Snowball Earth' model of Hoffman et al. [Science 281 (1998) 1342] has stimulated renewed interest in the causes of glaciation in Earth history and the sedimentary, stratigraphic and geochemical response. The model invokes catastrophic global Neoproterozoic refrigerations when oceans froze, ice sheets covered the tropics and global temperatures plummeted to -50 °C. Each event is argued to be recorded by tillites and have lasted up to 10 million years. Planetary biological activity was arrested only to resume in the aftermath of abrupt and brutal volcanically generated 'greenhouse' deglaciations when global temperatures reached +50 °C. The 'Cambrian explosion' is regarded by some as a consequence of post-Snowball glacioeustatic flooding of continental shelves. We shall show by a systematic review of the model that it is based on many long standing assumptions of the character and origin of the Neoproterozoic glacial record, in particular, 'tillites', that are no longer valid. This paper focusses on the sedimentological and stratigraphic evidence for glaciation in the light of current knowledge of glacial depositional systems. By integrating this analysis with recent understanding of the tectonic setting of Neoproterozoic sedimentary basins, an alternative 'Zipper-rift' hypothesis for Neoproterozoic glaciations is developed. The 'Zipper-rift' model emphasises the strong linkage between the first-order reorganisation of the Earth's surface created by diachronous rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia, the climatic effects of uplifted rift flanks and the resulting sedimentary record deposited in newly formed rift basins. Initial fragmentation of Rodinia commenced after about 750 Ma (when the paleo-Pacific Ocean started to form along the western margin of Laurentia) and culminated sometime after 610 Ma (with the opening of the paleo-Atlantic Ocean on the eastern margin of Laurentia). Breakup is recorded by well-defined 'tectonostratigraphic' successions that were deposited in marine rift basins. The base of each succession is characterised by coarse-grained synrift strata consisting of mass flow diamictites and conglomerates (many of the 'tillites' of the older literature). These facies are interbedded with large olistostromes and contain clastic carbonate debris derived from landsliding of fault scarps along rifted carbonate platforms. Diamictites and conglomerates are dominantly the product of subaqueous mass flow and mixing of coarse and fine sediment populations (the term mixtite has been used in the past). These facies are not uniquely glacial and are produced regardless of climate and latitude. Synrift deposits commonly pass up into thick slope turbidites recording enhanced subsidence and are capped by uppermost shallow marine strata that record a reduction in subsidence rates and overall basin shallowing. Tectonostratigraphic 'cycles' can attain thicknesses of several kilometres, but have been commonly misinterpreted as recording globally synchronous 'glacioeustatic', falls and rises in sea level. In fact, eustatic sea-level changes in rift basins are suppressed as a result of a strong tectonic control on relative water depths. The great length of newly formed rifted margins around the long perimeter of Laurentia ({\textless}20,000 km) ensured that deposition of tectonostratigraphic successions occurred diachronously as in the manner of a zipper between approximately 740 and 610 Ma. Some successions show a definite glacial influence on sedimentation as a consequence of latitude or strong tectonic uplift, but many do not. Regardless, all deposits record a fully functioning hydrological cycle entirely at odds with a supposed fully permafrozen planet. Mapping of those deposits where a definite glacial imprint is apparent indicates that Neoproterozoic glaciation(s) were likely regional or hemispheric in scope and latitudinally constrained. They were perhaps no more severe than other glaciations recorded in Earth history. The regional distribution of ice centres is argued to have been influenced by tectonic topography created by large mantle plumes and by rift shoulder uplift. Paleomagnetic data indicative of tropical glaciation are, in our view, ambiguous because of uncertainty as to when such paleomagnetic characteristics were acquired. A lower solar luminosity may have played a role in lowering snow line elevations and displacing glaciation into latitudes lower than those of Phanerozoic glaciations. Global tectonic and volcanic activity, especially the rapid burial or organic carbon in new rift basins, may explain extreme shifts in C-isotopic values evident in late Neoproterozoic strata. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The oxygen and strontium isotopic composition of 125 teeth of the hybodont sharks Lissodus and Hybodus from various late Triassic (Rhaetian) bone bed localities in the Central European Basin are used as environmental and ecological tracers for the shallow epicontinental Rhaetian Sea. The preservation of tooth enameloid was ascertained by cathodoluminescence microscopy. Mean $\delta$ 18O P values differ regionally across the Rhaetian Sea with values of 18.6±0.6‰ near the western gate, 16.1±0.8‰ in the east, 15.4±0.6‰ in the southeast, and 17.7±0.9‰ in the south. The $\delta$ 18O P values in the eastern Rhaetian Sea are 4-5‰ lower relative to Tethyan seawater, while teeth from the southern and western parts close to the marine gates are less fractionated. The strontium isotopic composition of teeth from most localities is more radiogenic in comparison to late Triassic seawater. The observed spatial $\delta$ 18O P trend in the Rhaetian Sea indicates a shift from marine to brackish conditions in the south and west towards extensively brackish conditions with salinities of less than 16‰ in the east, thus confirming the existence of two marine gates. Brackish conditions persisted throughout early Rhaetian times, and were maintained by increased fluvial discharge from the Vindelician-Bohemian and Fennoscandian Highs as a result of enhanced atmospheric moisture availability in the course of the Rhaetian transgression. The $\delta$ 18O P values of Lissodus and Hybodus indicate euryhaline behaviour of Rhaetian hybodonts by exceeding modern shark intraspecific variability. The lack of accordance in $\delta$ 18O P values between different isotopically conspicuous localities in the Rhaetian Sea contradicts a basin-wide migration pattern. Differences between co-site taxa might indicate some degree of niche partitioning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sulfur isotope fractionation experiments during bacterial sulfate reduction were performed with recently isolated strains of cold-adapted sulfate-reducing bacteria from Arctic marine sediments with year-round temperatures below 2°C. The bacteria represent quantitatively important members of a high-latitude anaerobic microbial community. In the experiments, cell-specific sulfate reduction rates decreased with decreasing temperature and were only slightly higher than the inferred cell-specific sulfate reduction rates in their natural habitat. The experimentally determined isotopic fractionations varied by less than 5.8‰ with respect to temperature and sulfate reduction rate, whereas the difference in sulfur isotopic fractionation between bacteria with different carbon oxidation pathways was as large as 17.4‰. Incubation of sediment slurries from two Arctic localities across an experimental temperature gradient from -4°C to 39°C yielded an isotopic fractionation of 30‰ below 7.6°C, a fractionation of 14‰ and 15.5‰ between 7.6°C and 25°C, and fractionations of 5‰ and 8‰ above 25°C, respectively. In absence of significant differences in sulfate reduction rates in the high and low temperature range, respectively, we infer that different genera of sulfate-reducing bacteria dominate the sulfate-reducing bacterial community at different temperatures. In the Arctic sediments where these bacteria are abundant the isotopic differences between dissolved sulfate, pyrite, and acid-volatile sulfide are at least twice as large as the experimentally determined isotopic fractionations. On the basis of bacterial abundance and cell-specific sulfate reduction rates, these greater isotopic differences cannot be accounted for by significantly lower in situ bacterial sulfate reduction rates. Therefore, the remaining isotopic difference between sulfate and sulfide must derive from additional isotope effects that exist in the oxidative part of the sedimentary sulfur cycle.

abstract = {Data have been obtained, from our own chemical analyses and from the literature, for the concentrations of organic carbon (C) and pyrite sulfur (S) in over 600 samples of Cambrian to recent normal marine shales. (Normal marine refers to deposition in oxygenated bottom water as evidenced by the presence of benthic fossils and/or indicators of bioturbation). All samples were selected to minimize 1. (1) loss of C and/or S due to weathering at the outcrop (by emphasizing the use of drill core material) 2. (2) analytical errors and non-diagenetic effects (by avoiding sediments low in C or S content such as sandstones) 3. (3) Fe limitation of pyrite formation (by avoiding limestones, cherts, and euxinic shales) 4. (4) metamorphic loss of C, relative to S (by avoiding rocks obviously subjected to, even low-grade, metamorphism). Our results indicate that (1) there is generally a good positive linear correlation between organic C and pyrite S for normal marine shales of all ages and (2) the mean C S ratio for normal marine shales has varied over time. Devonian to Tertiary shales exhibit mean C S weight ratios (1.8 ?? 0.5) somewhat lower than Quaternary sediments (mean C S = 2.8). This we believe is due to preferential C loss (relative to S) during biogenic methanogenesis plus diagenetic heating. Distinctly lower mean C/S values for the Cambrian and Ordovician (0.5 ?? 0.1) cannot be explained solely in terms of diagenetic C loss and, instead, must represent low original ratios. The low original ratios, we suggest, were due mainly to the absence of bacterially refractory organic matter added to the marine environment by rivers at that time, because the major source of such material, vascular land plants, had not yet evolved. This, along with a possibly lower degree of bioturbation, contributed to enhanced pyrite formation and preservation and, thus, lower early Paleozoic C S ratios. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {The Huangzhishan section, 40 km from the well-known Meishan section, Zhejiang Province, South China, records a carbonate-siliciclastic Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary succession. The P/Tr boundary sequences in both sections correlate well with one another, although the succession is much thicker at Huangzhishan than its equivalent at Meishan. The P/Tr transition is constrained by the Neogondolella yini, N. meishanensis and Hindeodus parvus conodont zones. Of these, the boundary between the first two zones marks the end-Permian mass extinction horizon. The base of H. parvus Zone defines the P/Tr boundary. The P/Tr mass extinction event is also indicated by a dramatic negative shift of the $\delta$13Ccarb profile. This ecological crisis was facilitated by an abrupt environmental devastation indicated by an anoxic event. At Huangzhishan benthic habitats varied from open, oxygenated, to anoxic, to dysoxic-oxygenated and to dysoxic-anoxic conditions throughout the latest Changhsingian to early Griesbachian. Biotic turnover across the P/Tr boundary suggests the P/Tr mass extinction may have included two episodes in Huangzhishan. The first, perhaps major, episode occurs at the base of N. meishanensis Zone, corresponding to the event recorded at the base of Bed 25 in Meishan. The second coincides with the boundary between the H. parvus Zone and overlying Claraia-Ophiceras Assemblage zone, equivalent to the event recorded at the base of Bed 28 in Meishan. The first event did not see a significant decline in biodiversity, but is marked by an apparent loss of high-classification groups such as corals, sponges, macroalgae and most foraminifers. The Huangzhishan section records the most abundant and diverse surviving faunas among the P/Tr boundary sections around the world, with 54 species in 36 genera. However, they are severely affected by the Lilliput effect over the P/Tr extinction. Several fossil groups (bryozoans, blastoids and crinoids) temporarily survived the first episode of the P/Tr extinction and persisted into the earliest Triassic in Huangzhishan. Most survivors became extinct in the second episode of the P/Tr crisis. The Eumorphotis-Towapteria-Pteria bivalve fauna, widespread in shallow-water facies conodont-free P/Tr boundary sections in South China, occurs within the H. parvus Zone in Huangzhishan. This bivalve fauna therefore marks the P/Tr boundary in the conodont-barren P/Tr boundary sections. The top of this bivalve assemblage zone marks the second episode of the P/Tr crisis. Another slightly older bivalve fauna dominated by primitive forms of Claraia (e.g. C. bioni) marks the first/or main episode of the P/Tr extinction in the conodont-barren P/Tr boundary sections.},

@article{Algeo2009,
abstract = {Modern low-oxygen marine systems exhibit patterns of molybdenum-uranium covariation that can be linked to specific attributes and processes of the depositional system, including (1) variation in benthic redox conditions, (2) the operation of particulate shuttles within the water column, and (3) the evolution of watermass chemistry. The importance of these factors in each depositional system can be assessed both from the degree of enrichment of authigenic molybdenum (Moauth) and uranium (Uauth) and from the (Mo/U)auth ratio of the sediment relative to the seawater Mo/U molar ratio of {\~{}} 7.5-7.9. In open-ocean systems with suboxic bottomwaters, Uauth enrichment tends to exceed that of Moauth owing to onset of Uauth accumulation at the Fe(II)-Fe(III) redox boundary, resulting in sediment (Mo/U)auth ratios less than that of seawater. As bottomwaters become increasingly reducing and at least occasionally sulfidic, the rate of accumulation of Moauth increases relative to that of Uauth, and sediment (Mo/U)auth ratios equal or exceed that of seawater. In restricted marine systems with permanently sulfidic deepwaters, the relative enrichment of Moauth and Uauth depends on additional factors. In the Cariaco Basin, which has an aqueous Mo/U ratio similar to that of seawater, the operation of a particulate Mn-Fe-oxyhydroxide shuttle serves to accelerate the transfer of Mo to the seafloor, leading to strong enrichments in Moauth relative to Uauth. In the Black Sea, the chemistry of the deep watermass has evolved to the point where its aqueous Mo/U ratio is only {\~{}} 0.04 that of seawater, as a consequence of which sediments deposited under deepwater influence are depleted in Moauth relative to Uauth. These Mo-U covariation patterns can be used to gain a better understanding of the watermass attributes and processes of ancient low-oxygen marine systems. Analysis of anoxic facies from two North American paleomarine systems, the Late Pennsylvanian Midcontinent Sea (LPMS) and the Late Devonian Seaway (LDS), reveals authigenic Mo-U relationships similar to those of the modern marine environments above, implying similar redox and hydrographic controls. The observed patterns are consistent with laterally unconfined circulation and strong watermass exchange within the LPMS, and with markedly restricted deepwater circulation in silled basins of the LDS. Patterns of authigenic Mo-U covariation may prove useful in analysis of other paleoceanographic systems to reveal aspects of watermass composition and environmental dynamics.},

abstract = {Sedimentary rocks examined by the Curiosity rover at Yellowknife Bay, Mars, were derived from sources that evolved from an approximately average martian crustal composition to one influenced by alkaline basalts. No evidence of chemical weathering is preserved, indicating arid, possibly cold, paleoclimates and rapid erosion and deposition. The absence of predicted geochemical variations indicates that magnetite and phyllosilicates formed by diagenesis under low-temperature, circumneutral pH, rock-dominated aqueous conditions. Analyses of diagenetic features (including concretions, raised ridges, and fractures) at high spatial resolution indicate that they are composed of iron- and halogen-rich components, magnesium-iron-chlorine-rich components, and hydrated calcium sulfates, respectively. Composition of a cross-cutting dike-like feature is consistent with sedimentary intrusion. The geochemistry of these sedimentary rocks provides further evidence for diverse depositional and diagenetic sedimentary environments during the early history of Mars.},

abstract = {Challenger Mound, a 150-m-high cold-water coral mound on the eastern flank of the Porcupine Seabight off SW Ireland, was drilled during Expedition 307 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). Retrieved cores offer unique insight into an archive of Quaternary paleo-environmental change, long-term coral mound development, and the diagenetic alteration of these carbonate fabrics over time. To characterize biogeochemical carbon-iron-sulfur transformations in the mound sediments, the contents of dithionite- and HCl-extractable iron phases, iron monosulfide and pyrite, and acid-extractable calcium, magnesium, manganese, and strontium were determined. Additionally, the stable isotopic compositions of pore-water sulfate and solid-phase reduced sulfur compounds were analyzed. Sulfate penetrated through the mound sequence and into the underlying Miocene sediments, where a sulfate-methane transition zone was identified. Small sulfate concentration decreases ({\textless}7 mM) within the top 40 m of the mound suggested slow net rates of present-day organoclastic sulfate reduction. Increasing $\delta$(34)S-sulfate values due to microbial sulfate reduction mirrored the decrease in sulfate concentrations. This process was accompanied by oxygen isotope exchange with water that was indicated by increasing $\delta$(18)O-sulfate values, reaching equilibrium with pore-water at depth. Below 50 mbsf, sediment intervals with strong (34)S-enriched imprints on chromium-reducible sulfur (pyrite S), high degree-of-pyritization values, and semi-lithified diagenetic carbonate-rich layers characterized by poor coral preservation, were observed. These layers provided evidence for the occurrence of enhanced microbial sulfate-reducing activity in the mound in the past during periods of rapid mound aggradation and subsequent intervals of non-deposition or erosion when geochemical fronts remained stationary. During these periods, especially during the Early Pleistocene, elevated sulfate reduction rates facilitated the consumption of reducible iron oxide phases, coral dissolution, and the subsequent formation of carbonate cements.},

This integrates the sedimentology and ichnology, where the higher grades of bioturbation result from increased burrow overlap and the subsequent loss of the primary sedimentary fabric. (2) An ichnofabric constituent diagram which records the detail of the ichnofabric by graphically plotting the dimensional data of the ichnotaxa and their order of emplacement against their coverage. This scheme differs from previous attempts to characterize bioturbation using semi-quantatitive methods and visually portrays the ichnofabric so that comparative studies can be carried out.

@article{Pickard1996,
abstract = {Following a series of mass extinction events towards the end of the Devonian (Frasnian), true skeletal reef-building organisms were effectively lost from latest Devonian (Famennian) and Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, nonskeletal, mud-dominated buildups (mud-mounds) are common throughout this geological interval, and microbial activity (fungi, algae and/or bacteria) is considered to have played a significant role in the development of these buildups. Evidence of microbial activity in Dinantian buildups may be divided into two broad categories: (a) direct evidence, such as the development of stromatolitic and thrombolitic macrostructures, presence of cryptic incrustations and preservation of calcimicrobes such as Renalcis; (b) cryptic evidence, in the form of peloidal mud' which forms the matrix of many Dinantian buildups. The matrix peloidal micrites closely resemble modern microbially mediated (algal and bacterial) carbonate precipitates. Precipitation of the peloidal fabrics is considered to have occurred within a microbial mat that bound the accreting buildup surface, thereby allowing steep depositional slopes to develop in deep water buildups and protecting shallow water buildups from erosion. Extensive cavity systems, often developed in Dinantian buildups, may also contain stromatolitic mats and micritized cavity walls. These fabrics indicate the additional presence of internal heterotrophic microbial communities and suggest that a diverse range of microbes were present in Dinantian buildups. Controls on the development of Dinantian buildups are likely to have been multiple. Nutrient-rich (mesotrophic) water masses, in combination with relatively low sedimentation rates, may have promoted buildup initiation, while regional palaeogeography and tectonic events played a role in their location. Tournaisian buildups commonly developed in a wide range of water depths on carbonate ramps, whereas Visean buildups, particularly in northwestern Europe, were often restricted to relatively shallow water over tectonically controlled topographic highs. Evolution of new organisms during mid-Carboniferous time led to a diversification of buildup types. However, microbial fabrics identical to those developed in Dinantian buildups are still present in many late Carboniferous and Permian phylloid algal, Palaeoaplysina and bryozoan buildups. The role of microbial activity in the development of these late Carboniferous and Permian buildups may have been greatly underestimated.},

There is extensive evidence that recent climatic change has affected animal and plant populations, but no indicators exist that summarise impacts over many species and large areas. We use data on long-term population trends of European birds to develop such an indicator. We find a significant relationship between interspecific variation in population trend and the change in potential range extent between the late 20{\textless}sup{\textgreater}th{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and late 21{\textless}sup{\textgreater}st{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} centuries, forecasted by climatic envelope models. Our indicator measures divergence in population trend between bird species predicted by climatic envelope models to be favourably affected by climatic change and those adversely affected. The indicator shows a rapid increase in the past twenty years, coinciding with a period of rapid warming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Difficulties associated with reconstructing past changes in export production were highlighted recently by Averyt and Paytan (2004), who reported substantial disagreement among records developed using different paleoproductivity proxies extracted from two equatorial Pacific piston cores. Proxies included the accumulation rates of barite, excess Ba, and excess Al, as well as elemental ratios of Al/Ti and Ba/Ti. Here we build upon their work by presenting evidence for two factors that contributed to these discrepancies. First, elemental (Ba/Ti and Al/Ti) ratios are influenced by variability in space and time of the flux of Ti to equatorial Pacific sediments, so these proxies cannot be expected to hold a constant relationship to export production. Second, the late Holocene increase in CaCO3 dissolution has caused concentrations of barite, excess Ba, and excess Al to be enriched in surface sediments relative to the depth interval over which sediment accumulation rates were evaluated in developing the algorithms used by Averyt and Paytan (2004). This produces an error in the accumulation rates of these proxies that varies from core to core, ranging from a few tens of percent to as much as a factor of 3. These errors would have been propagated into the export production algorithms on the basis of fluxes of barite, excess Ba, and excess Al. Furthermore, this bias created by the late Holocene increase in CaCO3 dissolution will affect the development of any algorithm based on fluxes of sedimentary constituents. These factors must be taken into account in future paleoceanographic reconstructions.},

Carbon isotope data highlight environmental changes across the P-T boundary and show the following features: (1) a gradual decrease of ∼4‰ to more than 7‰ starting in the Late Permian (Changhsingian) C. bachmanni Zone, with two superimposed transient positive excursions in the C. meishanensis-H. praeparvus and the M. ultima-S. ? mostleri Zones; (2) two $\delta$13C minima, the first at the P-T boundary and a higher, occasionally double-minimum in the lower I. isarcica Zone. It is unlikely that the short-lived phenomena, such as a breakdown in biological productivity due to catastrophic mass extinction, a sudden release of oceanic methane hydrates or meteorite impact(s), could have been the main control on the latest Permian carbon isotope curve because of its prolonged (0.5 Ma) duration, gradual decrease and the existence of a {\textgreater}1‰ positive shift at the main extinction horizon. The P-T boundary $\delta$13C trend matches in time and magnitude the eruption of the Siberian Traps and other contemporaneous volcanism, suggesting that volcanogenic effects, such as outgassed CO2 from volcanism and, even more, thermal metamorphism of organic-rich sediments, as the likely cause of the negative trend. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Modern study of the end-Permian mass extinction in the marine realm has involved intensive documentation of the fossil content, sedimentology, and chemostratigraphy of individual stratigraphic sections where the mass extinction interval is well preserved. These studies, coupled with innovative modeling of environmental conditions, have produced specific hypotheses for the mechanisms that caused the mass extinction and associated environmental stress. New paleobiological studies on the environmental distribution and ecological importance of brachiopods, benthic molluscs, and bryozoans support the hypothesis that stressful ocean conditions{\&}8212;primarily elevated H2S levels (euxinia) but also heightened CO2 concentrations{\&}8212;were the prime causes of the end-Permian mass extinction. These studies also further demonstrate that both the Late Permian interval preceding this mass extinction and the Early Triassic interval that followed were times of similar elevated environmental stress. In the low-diversity Early Triassic biosphere, huge numbers of benthic molluscs, in particular four cosmopolitan genera of bivalves, typically covered the seafloor. That a few marine genera thrived during this time indicates a greater than usual tolerance to some combination of marine anoxia, as well as elevated CO2 and/or increased H2S concentrations. Research focusing on experiments with modern organisms similar to those that died, as well as those that thrived, in microcosms where levels of O2, CO2, and H2S can be experimentally manipulated will enable an even more detailed understanding of the nature of this greatest Phanerozoic biotic crisis.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of 20 experiments in which mixes of two or three feldspars were reacted to produce coexisting plagioclase feldspar (PF) and alkali feldspar (AF). Experiments were carried out over the range 700 to 900 °C and 1 to 3 kbar under watersaturated conditions. The compositions of experimental products were determined using the electron microprobe. Starting materials with similar bulk compositions were prepared using different combinations of two and three minerals, and experiments were designed to produce similar AF and PF minerals in the experimental products from different starting binary and ternary compositions. The coexisting AF and PF compositions produced as products define compositional fields that are elongate parallel to the ternary solvus. In 11 experiments reaction was sufficient to produce fields of coexisting AF and PF, or AF, PF, and melt with a bulk composition close to that of the starting mixture. In six experiments significant reaction occurred in the form of reaction rim overgrowths on seeds of the starting materials, but a tie line connecting AF and PF products lies on the Ab-rich side of the starting bulk composition. In these six experiments some of the An-rich plagioclase starting material was removed from reaction by overgrowth of reaction rims. Three experiments produced AF, PF, and melt from a natural granite starting material. The experiments probably approached stable or metastable exchange equilibrium with respect to Na-K-Ca, but an equilibrium degree of AI-Si order in the rims was most likely not achieved. A thermodynamic model following the approach developed by Ghiorso (1984) and Fuhrman and Lindsley (1988) is applied to these new experimental results. A two-feldspar thermometer is presented in which temperature is constrained by equilibria among all three components-Albite, Orthoclase, and Anorthite-in coexisting ternary feldspars.},

abstract = {Carbonate Associated Sulfate (CAS) is trace sulfate incorporated into carbonate minerals during their precipitation. Its sulfur isotopic composition is often assumed to track that of seawater sulfate and inform global carbon and oxygen budgets through Earth's history. However, many CAS sulfur isotope records based on bulk-rock samples are noisy. To determine the source of bulk-rock CAS variability, we extracted CAS from different internal sedimentary components micro-drilled from well-preserved Late Ordovician and early Silurian-age limestones from Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. Mixtures of these components, whose sulfur isotopic compositions vary by nearly 25???, can explain the bulk-rock CAS range. Large isotopic variability of sedimentary micrite CAS (34S-depleted from seawater by up to 15???) is consistent with pore fluid sulfide oxidation during early diagenesis. Specimens recrystallized during burial diagenesis have CAS 34S-enriched by up to 9??? from Hirnantian seawater, consistent with microbial sulfate reduction in a confined aquifer. In contrast to the other variable components, brachiopods with well-preserved secondary-layer fibrous calcite-a phase independently known to be the best-preserved sedimentary component in these strata-have a more homogeneous isotopic composition. These specimens indicate that seawater sulfate remained close to about 25??? (V-CDT) through Hirnantian (end-Ordovician) events, including glaciation, mass extinction, carbon isotope excursion, and pyrite-sulfur isotope excursion. The textural relationships between our samples and their CAS isotope ratios highlight the role of diagenetic biogeochemical processes in setting the isotopic composition of CAS.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic extinction event is considered to be the most devastating environmental crisis of the Phanerozoic. With many coinciding factors involved, the role of marine anoxia during the extinction is still poorly understood. In this study a boreal Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) section from Svalbard, Norway has been investigated with the aim of better understanding the timing and nature of local marine anoxia onset and extinction events across the PTB. The section comprises the Kapp Starostin and Vikingh{\o}gda formations; $\delta$13Corg values indicate the PTB is located within the lower part of the Vikingh{\o}gda Formation. Lag deposits at the top of the Kapp Starostin Formation indicate a marine hiatus and ensuing transgression during the Late Permian shortly before the extinction event, implying concurrence of major ecological changes and sea-level rise. Pyrite framboid size distributions and total organic carbon (TOC) were used to evaluate bottom water oxygen conditions, and show that changes in bottom water redox conditions and extinction are clearly linked. Oxic to dysoxic bottom water conditions prevailed during deposition of Kapp Starostin Formation sediments and changed to anoxic to euxinic conditions above the formation boundary. The onset of anoxia is not abrupt but rather shows a gradual increase within the Kapp Starostin Formation during the Late Permian. The tipping point where bottom waters reach a long-term state of anoxia to euxinia coincides with the final extinction event, though changes in biotic assemblages at the top of the Kapp Starostin Formation indicate a marine ecosystem crisis prior to this. Oxygen depletion in the boreal region, as seen in our study section and correlating to Greenland and Arctic Canada, seems to be consistently more severe than in lower latitude settings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = { The investigation of the trace element and organic geochemistry of the Frasnian-Famennian boundary section at Kowala (Holy Cross Mountains/Poland) shows that the lower water column was oxygen-deficient during late Frasnian and early Famennian times. The abundance and carbon isotopic composition of diaryl isoprenoids, biomarkers indicative for green sulfur bacteria, prove that euxinic waters reached into the photic zone, at least episodically. Total organic carbon (TOC) contents show two maxima that are time-equivalent to the Kellwasser horizons deposited in shallower water settings. Enhanced TOC concentrations are explained by a higher primary productivity, presumably as a consequence of an enhanced nutrient supply from the continent. The increase in the abundance of hopanes and bituminite suggests that the bacterial contribution to TOC increased at the Frasnian-Famennian transition. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyritic- and organically bound sulfur shows a +27 per mil excursion across the boundary. The observation that the delta (super 34) S values of organic-bound sulfur closely resemble that of pyrite sulfur indicates a common sulfur source, likely early diagenetic sulfide. A change in the delta (super 13) C of total dissolved inorganic carbon as a consequence of an enhanced burial of (super 12) C-enriched organic carbon is indicated by a +3 per mil excursion measured for TOC as well as for individual n-alkanes and isoprenoids. The burial of large amounts of organic carbon is expected to result in a decrease in pCO (sub 2) and should affect the photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation (epsilon (sub p) ). The fact that we observe no change in epsilon (sub p) can be explained by the circumstance that epsilon (sub p) was most probably at maximum values, as a consequence of high atmospheric and oceanic-dissolved CO (sub 2) concentrations during the Devonian.},

Indeed, up to 5 mM methane was measured in the porewater. The archaeal membrane lipid archaeol showing d13C values between 15 and 0{\&} suggests that archaea are present and producing methane in the modern lagoon sediment. Moreover, 13C-depleted hopanoids diplopterol and 3b-methylated C32 17b(H),21b(H)-hopanoic acid (both 40{\&}) are preserved in lagoon sediments and are most likely derived from aerobic methanotrophic bacteria thriving in the methane-enriched water column. Loss of isotopically light methane through the water column would explain the residual 13C-enriched pool of dissolved inorganic carbon from where the carbonate constituting the stromatolites precipitated. The predominance of methanogenic archaea in the lagoon is most likely a result of sulphate limitation, suppressing the activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria under brackish conditions in a seasonally humid tropical environment. Indeed, sulphate-reduction activity is very low in the modern sediments. In absence of an efficient carbonate-inducing metabolic process, we propose that stromatolite formation in Lagoa Salgada was abiotically induced, while the 13C-enriched organic and inorganic carbon pools are due to methanogenesis. Unusually, 13C-enriched stromatolitic deposits also appear in the geological record of prolonged periods in the Palaeo- and Neoproterozoic. Lagoa Salgada represents a possible modern analogue to conditions that may have been widespread in the Proterozoic, at times when low sulphate concentrations in sea water allowed methanogens to prevail over sulphatereducing bacteria.},

abstract = {Records of more than 20 Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) sections from South China show that widespread end-Permian regression took place in whole South China. Timing of the low ebb of this regression was pinpointed to the Clarkina meishanensis and Hindeodus changxingensis zones. Biostratigraphic and paleogeographic studies at conodont zonation level reveal that the Yangtze Carbonate Platform and isolated small carbonate platforms in the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi (HGG) Basin experienced sedimentary hiatus during these two zones which lasted about 50-100 kya. Meanwhile the basinal areas, namely the Northern Marginal Basin of Yangtze Platform and the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi Basin, have continuous conodont zonation with silicious and ashbed deposits. The basinal areas show two negative $\delta$13C shifts during the PTB interval from Clarkina yini zone to Isarcicella isarcica zone, while on the platforms there is usually only one negative shift because the early shift at C. meishanensis zone was lost during hiatus. The end-Permian regression and successive rapid transgression taking place at the PTB casted important effects to the pattern and process of the PTB mass extinction. The depositional hiatus hitherto underestimated will necessitate reassessment of some interpretations on the causes and results of that extinction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The end of the Permian was a time of crisis that culminated in the Earth's greatest mass extinction. There is much speculation as to the cause for this catastrophe. Here we provide a full suite of high-resolution and coeval geochemical results (trace and rare earth elements, carbon, oxygen, strontium and clumped isotopes) reflecting ambient seawater chemistry and water quality parameters leading up to the end‐Permian crisis. Preserved brachiopod low-Mg calcite-based seawater chemistry, supplemented by data from various localities, documents a sequence of interrelated primary events such as coeval flows of Siberian Trap continental flood basalts and emission of carbon dioxide leading to warm and extreme Greenhouse conditions with sea surface temperatures (SST) of {\~{}} 36 °C for the Late Permian. Although anoxia has been advanced as a cause for the mass extinction, most biotic and geochemical evidence suggest that it was briefly relevant during the early phase of the event and only in areas of upwelling, but not a general cause. Instead, we suggest that renewed and increased end‐Permian Siberian Trap volcanic activity, about 2000 years prior to the extinction event, released massive amounts of carbon dioxide and coupled with thermogenic methane emissions triggered extreme global warming and increased continental weathering. Eventually, these rapidly discharged greenhouse gas emissions, less than 1000 years before the event, ushered in a global Hothouse period leading to extreme tropical SSTs of {\~{}} 39 °C and higher. Based on these sea surface temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were about 1400 ppmv and 3000 ppmv for the Late and end‐Permian, respectively. Leading up to the mass extinction, there was a brief interruption of the global warming trend when SST dropped, concurrent with a slight, but significant recovery in biodiversity in the western Tethys. It is possible that emission of volcanic sulfate aerosols resulted in brief cooling just after the onset of intensified warming during the end of the Permian. After aerosol deposition, global warming resumed and the biotic decline proceeded, and was accompanied by suboxia, in places of the surface ocean which culminated in the greatest mass extinction in Earth history.},

abstract = {Carbonate rocks from the Middle Ediacaran period in locations all over the globe record the largest excursion in carbon isotopic compositions in Earth history. This finding suggests a dramatic reorganization of Earth's carbon cycle. Named the Shuram excursion for its original discovery in the Shuram Formation, Oman, the anomaly closely precedes impressive events in evolution, including the rise of large metazoans and the origin of biomineralization in animals. Instead of a true record of the carbon cycle at the time of sedimentation, the carbon isotope signature recorded in the Shuram excursion could be caused by alteration following deposition of the carbonate sediments, a scenario supported by several geochemical indicators. However, such secondary processes are intrinsically local, which makes it difficult to explain the coincident occurrence of carbon isotope anomalies in numerous records around the globe. Both possibilities are intriguing: if the Shuram excursion preserves a genuine record of ancient seawater chemistry, it reflects a perturbation to the carbon cycle that is stronger than any known perturbations of the modern Earth. If, however, it represents secondary alteration during burial of sediments, then marine sediments must have been globally preconditioned in a unique way, to allow ordinary and local processes to produce an extraordinary and widespread response.},

abstract = {The occurrence of microbialites in post-glacial coral reefs has been interpreted to reflect an ecosystem response to environmental change. The greater thickness of microbialites in reefs with a volcanic hinterland compared to thinner microbial crusts in reefs with a non-volcanic hinterland led to the suggestion that fertilization of the reefal environment by chemical weathering of volcanic rocks stimulated primary productivity and microbialite formation. Using a molecular and isotopic approach on reef-microbialites from Tahiti (Pacific Ocean), it was recently shown that sulfate-reducing bacteria favored the formation of microbial carbonates. To test if similar mechanisms induced microbialite formation in other reefs as well, the Tahitian microbialites are compared with similar microbialites from coral reefs off Vanuatu (Pacific Ocean), Belize (Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean), and the Maldives (Indian Ocean) in this study. The selected study sites cover a wide range of geological settings, reflecting variable input and composition of detritus. The new lipid biomarker data and stable sulfur isotope results confirm that sulfate-reducing bacteria played an intrinsic role in the precipitation of microbial carbonate at all study sites, irrespective of the geological setting. Abundant biomarkers indicative of sulfate reducers include a variety of terminally-branched and mid chain-branched fatty acids as well as mono-O-alkyl glycerol ethers. Isotope evidence for bacterial sulfate reduction is represented by low $\delta$ 34S values of pyrite (-43 to -42‰) enclosed in the microbialites and, compared to seawater sulfate, slightly elevated $\delta$ 34S and $\delta$ 18O values of carbonate-associated sulfate (21.9 to 22.2‰ and 11.3 to 12.4‰, respectively). Microbialite formation took place in anoxic micro-environments, which presumably developed through the fertilization of the reef environment and the resultant accumulation of organic matter including bacterial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), coral mucus, and marine snow in cavities within the coral framework. ToF-SIMS analysis reveals that the dark layers of laminated microbialites are enriched in carbohydrates, which are common constituents of EPS and coral mucus. These results support the hypothesis that bacterial degradation of EPS and coral mucus within microbial mats favored carbonate precipitation. Because reefal microbialites formed by similar processes in very different geological settings, this comparative study suggests that a volcanic hinterland is not required for microbialite growth. Yet, detrital input derived from the weathering of volcanic rocks appears to be a natural fertilizer, being conductive for the growth of microbial mats, which fosters the development of particularly abundant and thick microbial crusts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A simple procedure for preparing barite samples for chemical and isotopic analysis is described. Sulfate ion, in barite, in the presence of high concentrations of aqueous sodium carbonate, is replaced by carbonate. This replacement forms insoluble carbonates with the cations commonly in barite: Ba, Sr, Ca and Pb. Sulfate is released into the solution by the carbonate replacement and is separated by filtration. The aqueous sulfate can then be reprecipitated for analysis of the sulfur and oxygen isotopes. The cations in the carbonate phase can be dissolved by acidifying the solid residue. Sr can be separated from the solution for Sr isotope analysis by ion-exchange chromatography. The sodium carbonate used contains amounts of Sr which will affect almost all barite 87Sr86Sr ratios by less than 0.00001 at 1.95$\theta$ of the mean. The procedure is preferred over other techniques used for preparing barite samples for the determination of 87Sr86Sr ratios because it is simple, rapid and enables simultaneous determination of many compositional parameters on the same material.},

abstract = {The five major mass extinctions identified in 1982 by Raup and Sepkoski have expanded to six, with the suggestion that the Permian-Triassic extinction was a double event. Is there a general explanation for great mass extinctions, or can they result from different triggers, or even from internal system instabilities? The two most-discussed candidates for a general extinction mechanism are impacts and flood-basalt eruptions. A compilation of evidence for impact at the times of mass extinctions shows that this cause is abundantly confirmed in the case of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction and the late Eocene, which is a time of minor and gradual extinction, but little or no evidence connects other major extinctions to impact. On the other hand, there is a remarkable time correlation between flood basalts and four major extinctions, but no other evidence that flood basalts cause mass extinctions. The evidence for an impact-extinction linkage is strikingly different from that for a connection between flood basalts and extinctions. Flood basalts cover larger areas than craters and their associated thick ejecta blankets, which are thus less likely to be found. Impacts distribute proxies globally at instantaneous time horizons, whereas flood-basalt events are extended in time, and no remote proxies have been recognized. Many global killing mechanisms have been proposed in the case of impacts, but few have been suggested for flood basalts. It is possible that flood basalts are triggered by impact, but it is not obvious how impacts could result from anything other than chance. The hypothesis that impacts are the general cause of mass extinctions has not received supporting evidence, but has not been falsified. The hypothesis that flood basalts are the general cause of mass extinctions is supported by evidence from timing, but is not susceptible to falsification. Other candidates for general extinction causes, especially sea-level changes and system instabilities, would require separate treatment. The question is still very much open.},

abstract = {The chemicalevolution of seawater during the Phanerozoic is still a matter of debate. We have assembled and critically analyzed the available data for the composition of fluid inclusions in marine halite and for the mineralogy of marine evaporites. The composition of fluid inclusions in primary marine halite reveals two major long-term cycles in the chemistry of seawater during the past 600 myr. The concentration of Mg2+, Ca2+, and SO42− has varied quite dramatically. The Mg2+ concentration in seawater during most of the early Paleozoic and Jurassic to Cretaceous was as low as 30 to 40 mmol/kg H2O; it reached maximum values ≥50 mmol/kg H2O during the Late Neoproterozoic and Permian. The Ca2+ concentration in seawater during the Phanerozoic has reached maximum values two to three times greater than the concentration in seawater today (10.6 mmol/kg H2O), whereas SO42− concentrations may have been as low as 5 to 10 mmol/kg H2O (a third to a fifth of the modern value) during the Jurassic and Early Paleozoic. The Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio in seawater ranged from 1 to 1.5 during the early to middle Paleozoic and Jurassic-Cretaceous to a near-modern value of 5.2 during the Late Neoproterozoic and Permian. This change in seawater Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio is consistent with the notion of alternating “calcite-aragonite seas” recorded in o{\"{o}}lites and marine carbonate cements. Several models have been proposed to explain the chemicalevolution of seawater. These have invoked significant changes in one or more of the major geochemical processes that control the composition of seawater. The pattern and magnitude of the variations in the composition of seawater proposed in this study are similar to those proposed elsewhere that suggest that seawater fluxes through midocean ridges have played a major role in the evolution of seawater during the past 600 myr. Two Phanerozoic supercycles of the Earth's exogenic processes were recognized in the literature that are caused by mantle convection and plate activity. The composition of seawater has apparently undergone dramatic secular changes in phase with these supercycles and as a consequence of biological evolution. Analyses of fluid inclusions containing unevaporated seawater and a better understanding of the processes that affect the composition of seawater are needed to refine our understanding of the history of Phanerozoicseawater.},

abstract = {The nitrogen isotopic composition of time-series sediment trap samples, dissolved NO3/-, and surficial sediments was determined in three regions along the margin of the eastern North Pacific: Monterey Bay, San Pedro Basin, and the Gulf of California (Carmen and Guaymas Basins). Complex physical regimes are present in all three areas, and each is influenced seasonally by coastal upwelling. Nevertheless, sediment trap material evidently records the isotopic composition of new nitrogen sources, since average $\delta$15N is generally indistinguishable from $\delta$15N values for subsurface NO3/-. Surficial sediments are also very similar to the average $\delta$15N value of the sediment traps, being within 1‰. This difference in $\delta$15N between trap material and sediment is much less than the previously observed 4‰ difference for the deep sea. Better organic matter preservation at our margin sites is a likely explanation, which may be due to either low bottom O2 concentrations or higher organic matter input to the sediments. All sites have $\delta$15N for sub-euphotic zone NO3/- (8-10‰) substantially elevated from the oceanic average (4.5-5‰). This isotopic enrichment is a result of denitrification in suboxic subsurface waters (Gulf of California) or northward transport of denitrification influenced water (Monterey Bay and San Pedro Basin). Our results therefore suggest that downcore $\delta$15N data, depending on site location, would record the intensity of denitrification and the transport of its isotopic signature along the California margin. Temporal variations in $\delta$15N for the sediment traps do appear to respond to upwelling or convective injections of NO3/- to surface waters as a result of isotopic fractionation during phytoplankton uptake. Overall, though, the coupling between NO3/- injection, $\delta$15N, and flux is looser than previously observed for the open-ocean, most likely the result of the smaller time/space scales of the events. In the Gulf of California, wintertime convective mixing/upwelling does produce distinct $\delta$15N minima co-occurring with particle flux maxima. Interannual variations are apparent in this region when these wintertime $\delta$15N minima fail to occur during El Nino conditions. There appears to be a positive relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly and annual average $\delta$15N. One explanation calls for hydrographic changes altering the $\delta$15N of subeuphotic zone NO3/-.},

abstract = {Microbial mats are dynamic and complex ecosystems exhibiting spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The physical/chemical environment is typified by steep gradients and distinct microenvironments. These microenvironments support a great diversity of species with a wide range of metabolic processes. These processes often result in coupled reactions and biogeochemical cycles, and produce important end products such as trace gases and mineral precipitates. The latter can impact the composition and character of the sediment, imparting a "biosignature." These biosignatures can be preserved in the rock record and are useful in the interpretation of fossil record on Earth and possibly as an indication of life on other planetary bodies. The modern marine stromatolites of the Exuma Cays, Bahamas, provide an ideal system for studying the populations, processes, and products in a microbial ecosystem using a multidisciplinary approach. In order to acquire redox energy, microbial populations need to carry out metabolic reactions at rates faster than the equivalent chemical (abiotic) reactions. As such, microbes can be viewed as bioreactors that preferably oxidize carbon to CO2 to maximize the energy yield. The study of the microbial role in carbonate sedimentation and lithification in these stromatolites provides a picture of microbial mats as bioreactors producing a biosignature. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A hypothesis of light sulfur injection to the ocean-atmosphere system at the end of the Permian was presented by Kaiho et al. [Kaiho, K., Kajiwara, Y.,Nakano, T., Miura, Y., Kawahata, H., Tazaki, K., Ueshima, M., Chen, Z.Q., Shi, G.R., 2001. End-Permian catastrophe by a bolide impact: evidence of a gigantic release of sulfur from the mantle. Geology 29, 815-818] based on a negative shift of S-34/S-32 ratio of carbonate-associated sulfate in South China. This hypothesis was discussed in some papers with additional data in other areas. However, the cause and distribution of the negative shift has not been clarified. Here we show that a significant decrease in the S-34/S-32 ratio of carbonate-associated sulfate occurred simultaneously in South China and Hungary at the end of the Permian, coincident with the end-Permian mass extinction. The cause of the abrupt negative shift of S-34/S-32 in these two distant sites is the injection of light sulfur to the surface ocean from the deep ocean rich in H2S, or deposits rich in sulfide, or the mantle. This sulfur isotope event was likely caused by either an abrupt warming, a bolide impact to the ocean, mantle plume-induced volcanism, or a harmonizing of these. Possible direct causes are (1) massive release of H2S gas from the euxinic surface and intermediate waters due to abrupt warming by volcanic CO2 or impact shock wave in the ocean, (2) a huge volcanisin penetrated sediments or ore rich in sulfide (3) an extraterrestrial impact to sulfide-rich sediments or ore deposit, and (4) release of mantle origin sulfur by an impact of {\textgreater} 70 km asteroid to the ocean. These are four possible causes for a mass extinction. There is also a possibility of a local oceanic event, only in the Tethys. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A carbonate crust, with a principally digitate structure, caps latest Permian reef complexes in east Sichuan, China. The crust contains the conodont Hindeodus parvus, confirming its age as earliest Triassic; it therefore closely postdates the end-Permian mass extinction, and is related to associated palaeoenvironmental change. Although its branches have lobate margins, and internal structures of radial fabrics and lobate fabrics in different specimens, an organic origin cannot be confirmed, because crust fabric is largely recrystallised. Therefore we apply the term ?microbialite to reflect uncertainty of its nature. The crust is co-eval (within the parvus Zone) with confirmed microbial biostromes and mounds in Guizhou Province, south of Sichuan. The sum of evidence, assembled by workers in several sites worldwide, indicates a sea-level rise occurred in the boundary interval, and this is corroborated by facies of the Sichuan crust. Abrupt appearance and disappearance of the crust, formed by precipitated carbonates, in east Sichuan, represents short-lived unusual post-extinction marine conditions which were switched abruptly on, then off. Microbial deposits overlying the P/T boundary in other locations in the Tethys Ocean (Iran and Japan) support the view that the unusual oceanic conditons had at least a regional distribution. Because the crust abruptly terminates, and is not succeeded by fossil-rich deposits, application of the disaster biota concept is inappropriate; an environmentally-driven control on carbonate precipitation is better supported by the evidence, whether or not it was biotically-mediated.},

abstract = {Near the end of the Late Ordovician, in the first of five mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic, about 85{\%} of marine species died. The cause was a brief glacial interval that produced two pulses of extinction. The first pulse was at the beginning of the glaciation, when sea-level decline drained epicontinental seaways, produced a harsh climate in low and mid-latitudes, and initiated active, deep-oceanic currents that aerated the deep oceans and brought nutrients and possibly toxic material up from oceanic depths. Following that initial pulse of extinction, surviving faunas adapted to the new ecologic setting. The glaciation ended suddenly, and as sea level rose, the climate moderated, and oceanic circulation stagnated, another pulse of extinction occurred. The second extinction marked the end of a long interval of ecologic stasis (an Ecologic-Evolutionary Unit). Recovery from the event took several million years, but the resulting fauna had ecologic patterns similar to the fauna that had become extinct. Other extinction events that eliminated similar or even smaller percentages of species had greater long-term ecologic effects.},

abstract = {Bulk and molecular stable C isotopic compositions and biomarker distributions provide evidence for a diverse community of algal and bacterial organisms in the sedimentary organic matter of a carbonate section throughout the Permian-Triassic (P/Tr) transition at the Idrijca Valley, Western Slovenia. The input of algae and bacteria in all the Upper Permian and Lower Scythian samples is represented by the predominance of C15-C22 n-alkanes, odd C-number alkylcyclohexanes, C27 steranes and substantial contents of C21-C30 acyclic isoprenoids. The occurrence of odd long-chain n-alkanes (C22-C30) and C29 steranes in all the samples indicate a contribution of continental material. The decrease of Corg and Ccarb contents, increase of Rock-Eval oxygen indices, and 13C-enrichment of the kerogen suggest a decrease in anoxia of the uppermost Permian bottom water. The predominance of odd C-number alkylcycloalkanes, C27 steranes, and C17 n-alkanes with [delta]13C values {\~{}}-30[per mille sign], and 13C-enrichment of the kerogens in the lowermost Scythian samples are evidence of greater algal productivity. This increased productivity was probably sustained by a high nutrient availability and changes of dissolved CO2 speciation associated to the earliest Triassic transgression. A decrease of Corg content in the uppermost Scythian samples, associated to a 13C-depletetion in the carbonates (up to 4[per mille sign]) and individual n-alkanes (up to 3.4[per mille sign]) compared to the Upper Permian samples, indicate lowering of the primary productivity (algae, cyanobacteria) and/or higher degradation of the organic matter.},

Here, we review the growing literature on marine extinctions and extinction risk in the fossil, historical, and modern records to compare the patterns, drivers, and biological correlates of marine extinctions at different times in the past. Characterized by markedly different environmental states, some past periods share common features with predicted future scenarios. We highlight how the different records can be integrated to better understand and predict the impact of current and projected future environmental changes on extinction risk in the ocean.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested rapid evolution of conodonts across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB), and the end-Permian mass extinction pattern varies in different sections in South China. Here we document a high-resolution conodont succession from a carbonate facies of the Changhsingian Stage and across the PTB at the Daijiagou section, about 35km north to Chongqing City, Southwest China. Two genera and twelve species are identified. Seven conodont zones are recognized from the uppermost part of the Lungtan Formation to the lowest Feixianguan Formation. They are the Clarkina liangshanensis, C. wangi, C. subcarinata, C. changxingensis, C. yini, C. meishanensis, and Hindeodus parvus zones in ascending order. Based on the high-resolution biostratigraphical framework at Daijiagou, the end-Permian mass extinction was rapid and it began in the base of the Clarkina meishanensis Zone. Associated with the extinction, a negative excursion of ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}carb{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} started in the middle part of Clarkina yini Zone with a progressive shift of 1.6??? to the middle part of the Clarkina meishanensis, followed by a sharp shift of 3.51??? from the Clarkina meishanensis Zone to the Hindeodus parvus Zone. Our study also suggests that the Triassic index species Hindeodus parvus co-occurred with Hindeodus changxingensis and Clarkina zhejiangensis and directly overlies the Clarkina meishanensis Zone at the Daijiagou section. All these data from the Daijiagou section and some previous studies of other sections in Sichuan, Guizhou provinces and Chongqing City suggest that the first occurrences of Hindeodus parvus are slightly earlier than the sharp negative excursion of ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}carb{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and the FAD at the Meishan GSSP section. We consider that the slight difference of the end-Permian mass extinction, chemostratigraphy and conodont biostratigraphy at Daijiagou and its adjacent areas is most likely subject to different lithofacies, fossil preservation, and the constraint on the stratigraphic resolution rather than a different tempo of the end-Permian mass extinction in a global sense. The whole Changhsingian conodont succession at Daijiagou provides a high-resolution correlation with other equivalent sections in the Palaeotethys. The controversial results of biostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy between the sections investigated in this paper and the Meishan GSSP section also provide some important implications that accurate chronocorrelation requires the evaluation of multiple, varied stratigraphcal signals rather than relying solely on the FAD of the Triassic index species Hindeodus parvus for recognizing the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). Growth series of abundant specimens for each species are figured. The taxonomy of some Hindeodus species in the PTB interval is updated.},

@article{Wignall2001,
abstract = {Comparing the timing of massextinctions with the formation age of largeigneousprovinces reveals a close correspondence in five cases, but previous claims that all such provinces coincide with extinction events are unduly optimistic. The best correlation occurs for four consecutive mid-Phanerozoic examples, namely the end-Guadalupian extinction/Emeishan flood basalts, the end-Permian extinction/Siberian Traps, the end-Triassic extinction/central Atlantic volcanism and the early Toarcian extinction/Karoo Traps. Curiously, the onset of eruptions slightly post-dates the main phase of extinctions in these examples. Of the seven post-Karoo provinces, only the Deccan Traps coincide with a massextinction, but in this case, the nature of the biotic crisis is best reconciled with the effects of a major bolide impact. Intraoceanic volcanism may also be implicated in a relatively minor end-Cenomanian extinction crisis, although once again the main phase of volcanism occurs after the crisis. The link between largeigneousprovince formation and extinctions remains enigmatic; volume of extrusives and extinction intensity are unrelated and neither is there any apparent relationship with the rapidity of province formation. Violence of eruptions (proportions of pyroclastics) also appears unimportant. Six out of 11 provinces coincide with episodes of global warming and marine anoxia/dysoxia, a relationship that suggests that volcanic CO2 emissions may have an important effect on global climate. Conversely, there is little, if any, geological evidence for cooling associated with continental flood basalt eruptions suggesting little long-term impact of SO2 emissions. Large carbon isotope excursions are associated with some extinction events and intervals of flood basalt eruption but these are too great to be accounted for by the release of volcanic CO2 alone. Thus, voluminous volcanism may in some circumstances trigger calamitous global environmental changes (runaway greenhouses), perhaps by causing the dissociation of gas hydrates. The variable efficiency of global carbon sinks during volcanic episodes may be an important control on environmental effects and may explain why the eruption of some vast igneousprovinces, such as the Paran{\'{a}}Etendeka Traps, have little perceptible climatic impact.},

abstract = {We explored the potential to use the stable isotopic compositions of planktonic foraminifera as a proxy for the position of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) in the Argentine Basin. For this purpose, we measured the oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of Globigerinoides ruber (pink and white varieties measured separately), Globigerinoides trilobus, Globigerina bulloides, Globorotalia inflata and Globorotalia truncatulinoides (left- and right-coiling forms measured separately) from a latitudinal transect of 56 surface sediment samples from the continental slope off Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina between 20 and 48°S. Lowest oxygen isotopes values were found in G. ruber (pink), followed by G. ruber (white) and G. trilobus reflecting the highly stratified near surface water conditions north of the BMC. Globigerina bulloides was present mainly south of the BMC and records subsurface conditions supporting earlier plankton tow studies. Globorotalia inflata and G. truncatulinoides (left and right) were both available over the whole transect and calcify in the depth level with the steepest temperature change across the BMC. Accordingly, the $\delta$18O of these species depict a sharp gradient of 2‰ at the confluence with remarkably stable values north and south of the BMC. Our data show that the oxygen isotopic composition of G. inflata and G. truncatulinoides (left and right) are the most reliable indicators for the present position of the BMC and can therefore be used to define the past migration of the front if appropriate cores are available. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This investigation of event sequences on the microfacies provided synthetically some clues to clarifying the previously proposed mechanisms of the end-Permian extinction. The deposit succession in Bed 24 of the Changxing Formation was developed dominantly with organic-rich lamina, but interrupted intermittently by storm disturbances. It indicates characteristically a stagnated, stratified and anoxic ocean during the latest Permian. The latest Permian transgression occurred rapidly at the top of Bed 24d and was characterized by the hard-ground interface. Abundant clay mineral of illite indicates the occurrence of persistent weathering of continental volcanics and then buried in ocean throughout this key Permo-Triassic transitional interval. However, the "boundary ash clay" of Bed 25 yielding normal grading of hyaloclastite was the result of precipitation of volcanic dusts. The firm-ground substrate in Unit 27-2 was lithe and excavated intensively by trace fossil Glossifungites; it means also the occurrence of the earliest Triassic rapid transgression and coincides with the first appearance of conodont Hindeodus parvus. Dune-shaped microbialite in Unit 27-5 defines biostratigraphically that its development, especially in the carbonate platform of South China, should correspond to the earliest Triassic; and it also indicates the final episode of the end-Permian extinction event. 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

Methane outbursts massive enough to account for observed carbon isotopic anomalies require unusually efficient release from thermal alteration of coal measures or from methane-bearing permafrost or marine methane-hydrate reservoirs due to bolide impact, volcanic eruption, submarine landslides, or global warming. The terminal Permian carbon isotopic anomaly has been regarded as a consequence of mass extinction, but atmospheric injections of methane and its oxidation to carbon dioxide could have been a cause of extinction for animals, plants, coral reefs and peat swamps, killing by hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, and pulmonary edema. Extinction by hydrocarbon pollution of the atmosphere is compatible with many details of the marine and terrestrial fossil records, and with observed marine and nonmarine facies changes. Multiple methane releases explain not only erratic early Triassic carbon isotopic values, but also protracted (∼6 m.y.) global suppression of coral reefs and peat swamps. },

abstract = {In an effort to better understand the factors influencing carbon fixation by Prochlorococcus, and to elucidate the effects of these cyanobacteria on the ocean carbon cycle, the kinetic parameters and isotopic discrimination of form IA ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) from Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9313 were determined. The RubisCO genes (cbbL and cbbS) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme was purified via ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the optimum pH and temperature, as well as Michaelis-Menton constants, were determined radiometrically. The degree to which this RubisCO discriminates against 13CO2 during fixation was determined by the high-precision substrate depletion method. Purified enzyme had a pH optimum of 7.5, was most active between 20°C and 30°C, had a moderate Vmax (0.41 µmol min-1 mg protein-1), and had the highest KCO2 value (0.75 mmol L-1) for a form I RubisCO characterized to date. The $\epsilon$ value, $\epsilon$ = 1,000[(k12/k13) - 1], for the enzyme was determined to be 24.0‰ (95{\%} C.I. = 22.2-25.6‰), within the range observed for other form I RubisCOs. This $\epsilon$ value is a critical baseline for interpreting the $\delta$13C values of marine environmental samples, particularly those collected from the open ocean, where P. marinus is responsible for a substantial fraction of carbon fixation.},

abstract = {Samples for stable isotope studies of possible chemosynthesis in anoxic basins were collected in 1986 in the Cariaco Trench and May 1988 in the Black Sea. POM (particulate organic matter) collected at oxic/anoxic interfaces in the water column showed no distinctive carbon or nitrogen isotopic compositions that could be associated with chemosynthetic bacteria. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions at POM concentration maxima near the top of the sulfide zone were −23{\%}o and 4.5{\%}o, respectively, in both the Black Sea and the Cariaco Trench. Measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Black Sea indicated that carbon respired during decomposition at depth had an isotopic composition of −23{\%}o and was isotopically similar to phytoplankton, with no distinctive component that could be attributed to chemosynthetic carbon. These results indicate that either the biomass of chemosynthetic bacteria in the oxic/anoxic interface zones is low relative to sinking phytoplankton or that chemoautotrophic bacteria have isotopic compositions similar to those of phytoplankton.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn the uppermost 50 m of sulfidic waters in the Black Sea, sulfide isotopic compositions changed significantly in a region of sulfide consumption, increasing up to 5{\%}o vs deep-water background values of −40.5{\%}o. These increases in sulfide isotopic compositions may be due to sulfide oxidation mediated by MnO2 or oxygen, but are not consistent with sulfide oxidation by photosynthetic bacteria. Growth experiments with sulfate-reducing bacteria suggested that part of the increase in sulfide isotopic compositions could be due to rapid rates of sulfate reduction in the oxic/anoxic interface regions.},

abstract = {The biomass, phylogenetic composition, and photoautotrophic metabolism of green sulfur bacteria in the Black Sea was assessed in situ and in laboratory enrichments. In the center of the western basin, bacteriochlorophyll e (BChl e) was detected between depths of 90 and 120 m and reached maxima of 54 and 68 ng liter(-1). High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis revealed a dominance of farnesyl esters and the presence of four unusual geranyl ester homologs of BChl e. Only traces of BChl e (8 ng liter(-1)) were found at the northwestern slope of the Black Sea basin, where the chemocline was positioned at a significantly greater depth of 140 m. Stable carbon isotope fractionation values of farnesol indicated an autotrophic growth mode of the green sulfur bacteria. For the first time, light intensities in the Black Sea chemocline were determined employing an integrating quantum meter, which yielded maximum values between 0.0022 and 0.00075 micromol quanta m(-2) s(-1) at the top of the green sulfur bacterial layer around solar noon in December. These values represent by far the lowest values reported for any habitat of photosynthetic organisms. Only one 16S rRNA gene sequence type was detected in the chemocline using PCR primers specific for green sulfur bacteria. This previously unknown phylotype groups with the marine cluster of the Chlorobiaceae and was successfully enriched in a mineral medium containing sulfide, dithionite, and freshly prepared yeast extract. Under precisely controlled laboratory conditions, the enriched green sulfur bacterium proved to be capable of exploiting light intensities as low as 0.015 micromol quanta m(-2) s(-1) for photosynthetic 14CO2 fixation. Calculated in situ doubling times of the green sulfur bacterium range between 3.1 and 26 years depending on the season, and anoxygenic photosynthesis contributes only 0.002 to 0.01{\%} to total sulfide oxidation in the chemocline. The stable population of green sulfur bacteria in the Black Sea chemocline thus represents the most extremely low-light-adapted and slowest-growing type of phototroph known to date.},

abstract = {Over the Early-Middle Frasnian boundary interval (Late Devonian), the oceans experienced major changes in global carbon cycling and nutrient dynamics with a prominent positive carbon isotope shift at the base of the Palmatolepis punctata Zone (Middle Frasnian). The aim of this study was to construct seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio curves for the Pa. transitans-Pa. hassi zonal interval using well-preserved conodont apatite from two sections in the Holy Cross Mountains, south-central Poland. The final curves suggest that seawater 87Sr/86Sr values were steady at {\~{}} 0.70794-0.70799 during the transitans Zone but began to rise in the early punctata Zone towards a value of {\~{}} 0.70814 in the late punctata Zone (an increase of {\~{}} 0.0002). The increase in seawater 87Sr/86Sr values over the Early-Middle Frasnian boundary appears to be the second of two prominent short-term rises in 87Sr/86Sr values, which led to an overall shift in values from a Givetian plateau of between {\~{}} 0.70780 and 0.70785 to a Late Frasnian plateau of between 0.7080 and 0.7082. Correlation with a regional positive ??13C anomaly and evidence for eutrophication in the marine environment suggests that the causes of these phenomena may be linked and that the positive 87Sr/86Sr shift was caused by an increase in the continental flux of Sr to the oceans, i.e., the weathering flux. A possible explanation for an increase in the weathering flux is the denudation of a new Acadian-Eovariscan orogen, which would have been mostly weathered in the humid, warm tropical/equatorial region. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aggregates of authigenic pyrite and gypsum were found at site HS373 in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Most of the pyrite occurs as tubes consisting of framboids. Gypsum aggregates are mainly represented by rosettes and some of them grew over pyrite, revealing that gypsum precipitation postdated pyrite formation. At seeps, extensive sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) commonly leads to the accumulation of 34S enriched sulfide, resulting in the formation of 32S depleted pyrite. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite at site HS373 reveals a great variability of 75.5??? in ??34S values, spanning from -37.6??? to 37.9??? (V-CDT) with a distinct trend towards higher values with increasing depth. This trend indicates an increase of the effect of sulfate-driven AOM with depth, whereas pyrite at shallow depth apparently resulted mostly from organiclastic sulfate reduction. To date, reports on coexisting pyrite and gypsum in seep environments are limited, and therefore the mechanism of gypsum formation is insufficiently understood. This is the first time that the sulfur and oxygen stable isotope composition of gypsum has been analyzed to understand its formation at seeps. The ??34S values of gypsum vary from -24.5??? to 0.9???, revealing a similar trend with depth like pyrite. The ??18Ogypsum values range from 5.3??? to 12.3??? (V-SMOW), with a scattered trend to lower values with depth. The combined evidence reveals that gypsum formation was linked to the establishment of more oxidizing conditions, probably caused by waning seepage. This led to the oxidation of pyrite and the associated increase in pore water sulfate and acidity, which favored carbonate mineral dissolution, providing the calcium ions required for gypsum formation. The observed isotopic variability of gypsum suggests that oxidation occurred by different mechanisms at different depth, whereby pyrite oxidation was dominated by aerobic processes at shallow depth involving dissolved molecular oxygen, and by anaerobic processes at greater depth involving electron acceptors like ferric iron. Taken together, the stable isotope compositions of pyrite and gypsum suggest that the redox conditions within the studied sediments were variable. Such variability was controlled by complex factors, among which changes in seepage activity have been instrumental for the vertical displacement of the sulfate methane transition zone.},

abstract = {Box cores recovered during Leg 4 of the 1988 R/V "Knorr" Black Sea Oceanographic Expedition from deep-water regions of the basin were dominated by coccolith-rich, microlaminated (Unit 1) sediment and muddy, gray turbidite layers. Both organic carbon (OC) and pyrite sulfur values for Unit 1 display narrow ranges, with mean concentrations of 5.3 ± 1.1 (1$\sigma$) wt{\%} and 1.3 ± 0.3 wt{\%}, respectively. Unit 1 is not enriched in pyrite-S relative to sediments deposited under oxygenated bottom waters (normal marine sediments) with comparable OC concentrations. Carbon-sulfur relationships (evaluated on a calcium carbonate-free basis to avoid spurious correlations resulting from dilution effects) demonstrate that OC and pyrite-S are essentially decoupled. These observations, combined with the persistence of elevated pore-water sulfide to depth and a strong correlation between pyrite-S and the detrital Fe component argue strongly for limitation of pyrite formation in Unit 1 by the availability of reactive Fe. Unit-1 Fe limitation is further indicated by degree-of-pyritization (DOP) studies (a measure of the extent to which the original potentially reactive Fe has been transformed to pyrite). These studies show sulfidation of reactive Fe ranging from 57{\%} to 78{\%}, with DOP values independent of OC concentration. Unit-1 DOP profiles suggest that the majority of the pyrite is formed in the sulfidic water column and/or very close to the sediment-water interface. Pyrite-S concentrations of Unit 1, when compared with the particulate reduced sulfur fluxes measured in time-series sediment traps, are compatible with predominantly water-column pyrite formation. Because of the limitations in the supply of reactive Fe associated with the comparatively high supply of OC, the microlaminated sediment is characterized by C/S ratios greater than those typical of Holocene oxically deposited sediments. The turbidite muds of the deep basin display high reduced S values (relative to Holocene normal marine sediments) in samples with low OC concentrations (low C/S ratios). This reflects pyrite formation under anoxic-sulfidic bottom-water conditions in a probable upper-slope source region, as well as during transport and final deposition. Intermediate DOP values for the turbidites, in part a product of their rapid rate of deposition, reveal that Fe limitation is ultimately not a factor and that further pyrite should form during burial. However, the very rapid rate at which Unit-1 pyrite forms suggests fundamental differences between the overall reactivities of the Fe phases associated with the microlaminated and turbiditic sediments. The signature of water-column anoxia with regard to sedimentary pyrite formation is clearly indicated by the high DOP values of Unit 1 and the comparatively high levels of S associated with the low concentrations of OC of the turbidite muds. This agrees with similar conclusions based on studies of ancient sedimentary rocks. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The fossil record of modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) provides no evidence for major extinction or radiation episodes throughout most of the Mesozoic and early Tertiary. However, long-term gradual diversification is difficult to reconcile with the sensitivity of present-day amphibian faunas to rapid ecological changes and the incidence of similar environmental perturbations in the past that have been associated with high turnover rates in other land vertebrates. To provide a comprehensive overview of the history of amphibian diversification, we constructed a phylogenetic timetree based on a multigene data set of 3.75 kb for 171 species. Our analyses reveal several episodes of accelerated amphibian diversification, which do not fit models of gradual lineage accumulation. Global turning points in the phylogenetic and ecological diversification occurred after the end-Permian mass extinction and in the late Cretaceous. Fluctuations in amphibian diversification show strong temporal correlation with turnover rates in amniotes and the rise of angiosperm-dominated forests. Approximately 86{\%} of modern frog species and {\textgreater}81{\%} of salamander species descended from only five ancestral lineages that produced major radiations in the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. This proportionally late accumulation of extant lineage diversity contrasts with the long evolutionary history of amphibians but is in line with the Tertiary increase in fossil abundance toward the present.},

abstract = {Reduced sulfur accumulation in Holocene and latest Pleistocene euxinic marine sediments from the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, was investigated to constrain the timing and possible pathways of organic matter (OM) sulfurization. Data were collected for a diverse suite of sulfur species, including concentrations and sulfur isotope compositions of pore-water sulfide, pore-water sulfate, pyrite sulfur, total organic sulfur (TOS), kerogen sulfur (KS), and polar bitumen sulfur (PBS). Results suggest that there was a period during which almost no diagenetic pyrite formed in the sediments of the Cariaco, coincident with a shift from high to lower sedimentation rates and a concomitant change in the delivery of organic matter to the sediments. The sulfur isotope composition of organic matter was predicted based on assumed pathways using weighted isotopic mass balance calculations and compared to measured isotope values for organic sulfur. These results indicate that organic sulfur is derived primarily from pore-water sulfide, with minor contributions from primary bio-sulfur (e.g., in proteins derived from algae and bacteria). The predicted sulfur isotope values of organic sulfur compounds (OSC) suggest that pore-water sulfide is the ultimate source of reduced sulfur for incorporation into organic matter. It is possible, however, that reactive sulfur intermediates such as elemental sulfur or polysulfides react directly with organic matter. These intermediate sulfur species are likely formed through partial oxidation of sulfide by anaerobic sulfide-oxidizing microbes living in the sediments. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fossil molecular (biomarker) and nitrogen isotopic records from a sedimentary sequence in western Canada provide the first conclusive evidence of PZE and disrupted biogeochemistry in neritic waters of the Panthalassic Ocean during the end Triassic. Increasing water-column stratification and deoxy- genation across the ETE led to PZE in the Early Jurassic, paral- leled by a perturbed nitrogen cycle and ecological turnovers among noncalcifying groups, including eukaryotic algae and prokaryotic plankton. If such conditions developed widely in the Panthalassic Ocean, PZE might have been a potent mechanism for the ETE.},

The values were measured on bulk carbonate, selected carbonate components and cements. Many of the studied carbonates are interpreted to exhibit primary marine ??13C values with only some showing evidence of diagenetic alteration. A ??13C curve is presented for the entire Devonian time interval. Positive ??13C excursions are documented in the woschmidti-postwoschmidti, sulcatus, kitabicus, Upper serotinus, kockelianus, Middle varcus, falsiovalis, Upper rhenana, linguiformis to Middle triangularis, and Middle to Upper praesulcata conodont Zones. Some excursions are recorded worldwide and interpreted to be of global significance as e.g. at the Silurian-Devonian and Frasnian-Famennian boundaries. Some of the others are described for the first time from Central and Southern Europe, and their global nature has to be verified by further investigations. Most ??13C excursions coincide with sea-level changes and the deposition of black shales. A coupling of changes in sea-level, weathering intensity, nutrient supply, organic carbon production, and climate is assumed as driving force of the carbon isotope excursions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Enrichment of dibenzofuran homologues across the Permian-Triassic boundary may corroborate the concept of excessive soil erosion following loss of rooted vegetation. Enrichment of alkylphenol entities occurs just below the main marine mass extinction horizon and prior to the characteristic end-Permian ??13C decline. The alkylphenols were probably derived from lignin and may provide a molecular record of dieback of woody vegetation. Highly decreased relative abundances of dibenzothiophenes could be indicative of excessive supply of Fe2+. It is suggested that Fe2+ was land-derived and may have originated from soils.

@article{Soetaert1996,
abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances. Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen. The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},

abstract = {Microbially mediated sulfate reduction affects the isotopic composition of dissolved and solid sulfur species in marine sediments. Experiments and field data show that the $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - composition is also modified in the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms. This has been attributed either to a kinetic isotope effect during the reduction of sulfate to sulfite, cell-internal exchange reactions between enzymatically-activated sulfate (APS), and/or sulfite with cytoplasmic water. The isotopic fingerprint of these processes may be further modified by the cell-external reoxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur, and the subsequent disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate or by the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Here we report $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - values from interstitial water samples of ODP Leg 182 (Site 1130) and provide the mathematical framework to describe the oxygen isotope fractionation of sulfate during microbial sulfate reduction. We show that a purely kinetic model is unable to explain our $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - data, and that the data are well explained by a model using oxygen isotope exchange reactions. We propose that the oxygen isotope exchange occurs between APS and cytoplasmic water, and/or between sulfite and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) during APS formation. Model calculations show that cell external reoxidation of reduced sulfur species would require up to 3000 mol/m3 of an oxidant at ODP Site 1130, which is incompatible with the sediment geochemical data. In addition, we show that the volumetric fluxes required to explain the observed $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - data are on average 14 times higher than the volumetric sulfate reduction rates (SRR) obtained from inverse modeling of the porewater data. The ratio between the gross sulfate flux into the microbes and the net sulfate flux through the microbes is depth invariant, and independent of sulfide concentrations. This suggests that both fluxes are controlled by cell density and that cell-specific sulfate reduction rates remain constant with depth. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The end-Guadalupian event selectively affected corals and broke down the cool-water carbonate factory. Sponges, however, were largely unaffected and bloomed in reefs toward the end of the Permian. The end-Permian total destruction of the metazoan reef system only left behind poorly diverse microbial communities. The temporal reef patterns are thus similar to spatial patterns of modern benthic communities approaching oxygen minimum zones. This observation suggests that a decline in oxygen concentrations was at least partly involved in the destruction of reefs, even where there is no direct evidence of oceanic anoxia.},

abstract = {The Mesozoic Era is characterized by numerous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) that are diagnostically expressed by widespread marine organic-carbon burial and coeval carbon-isotope excursions. Here we present coupled high-resolution carbon- and sulfur-isotope data from four European OAE 2 sections spanning the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary that show roughly parallel positive excursions. Significantly, however, the interval of peak magnitude for carbon isotopes precedes that of sulfur isotopes with an estimated offset of a few hundred thousand years. Based on geochemical box modeling of organic-carbon and pyrite burial, the sulfur-isotope excursion can be generated by transiently increasing the marine burial rate of pyrite precipitated under euxinic (i.e., anoxic and sulfidic) water-column conditions. To replicate the observed isotopic offset, the model requires that enhanced levels of organic-carbon and pyrite burial continued a few hundred thousand years after peak organic-carbon burial, but that their isotope records responded differently due to dramatically different residence times for dissolved inorganic carbon and sulfate in seawater. The significant inference is that euxinia persisted post-OAE, but with its global extent dwindling over this time period. The model further suggests that only {\~{}}5{\%} of the global seafloor area was overlain by euxinic bottom waters during OAE 2. Although this figure is {\~{}}30× greater than the small euxinic fraction present today ({\~{}}0.15{\%}), the result challenges previous suggestions that one of the best-documented OAEs was defined by globally pervasive euxinic deep waters. Our results place important controls instead on local conditions and point to the difficulty in sustaining whole-ocean euxinia.},

abstract = {The sulfur cycle influences the respiration of sedimentary organic matter, the oxidation state of the atmosphere and oceans, and the composition of seawater. However, the factors governing the major sulfur fluxes between seawater and sedimentary reservoirs remain incompletely understood. Using macrostratigraphic data, we quantified sulfate evaporite burial fluxes through Phanerozoic time. Approximately half of the modern riverine sulfate flux comes from weathering of recently deposited evaporites. Rates of sulfate burial are unsteady and linked to changes in the area of marine environments suitable for evaporite formation and preservation. By contrast, rates of pyrite burial and weathering are higher, less variable, and largely balanced, highlighting a greater role of the sulfur cycle in regulating atmospheric oxygen.},

The analysis of a global diversity data set of ammonoid genera covering about 106 million years centered on the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) shows that Triassic ammonoids actually reached levels of diversity higher than in the Permian less than 2 million years after the PTB. The data favor a hierarchical rather than logistic model of diversification coupled with a niche incumbency hypothesis. This explosive and nondelayed diversification contrasts with the slow and delayed character of the Triassic biotic recovery as currently illustrated for other, mainly benthic groups such as bivalves and gastropods. },

(2) The ??13C-values vary periodically from the base to the top in a stratigraphic unit. 3. (3) The ??13C-values are positive below, but negative above the Permian-Triassic boundary. The ??13C-values display a sharp drop within a limited stratigraphic interval (0.1 - 0.5 m) across the Permian-Triassic boundary. Our study and carbon isotope investigations of marine carbonate sequences across the Permian-Triassic boundary in other areas suggest that a drastic shift in carbon isotope compositions at the Permian-Triassic boundary probably occurred contemporaneously and globally, at least in the Tethys areas. The variation of carbon isotope compositions in marine stratigraphy sections may be used as a new criterion for stratigraphic correlation. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {The mineralogy of terrestrial planets evolves as a consequence of a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. In pre-stellar molecular clouds, widely dispersed microscopic dust particles contain approximately a dozen refractory minerals that represent the starting point of planetary mineral evolution. Gravitational clumping into a protoplanetary disk, star formation, and the resultant heating in the stellar nebula produce primary refractory constituents of chondritic meteorites, including chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions, with {\~{}}60 different mineral phases. Subsequent aqueous and thermal alteration of chondrites, asteroidal accretion and differentiation, and the consequent formation of achondrites results in a mineralogical repertoire limited to {\~{}}250 different minerals found in unweathered meteorite samples. Following planetary accretion and differentiation, the initial mineral evolution of Earth's crust depended on a sequence of geochemical and petrologic processes, including volcanism and degassing, fractional crystallization, crystal settling, assimilation reactions, regional and contact metamorphism, plate tectonics, and associated large-scale fluid-rock interactions. These processes produced the first continents with their associated granitoids and pegmatites, hydrothermal ore deposits, metamorphic terrains, evaporites, and zones of surface weathering, and resulted in an estimated 1500 different mineral species. According to some origin-of-life scenarios, a planet must progress through at least some of these stages of chemical processing as a prerequisite for life. Biological processes began to affect Earth's surface mineralogy by the Eoarchean Era ({\~{}}3.85-3.6 Ga), when large-scale surface mineral deposits, including banded iron formations, were precipitated under the influences of changing atmospheric and ocean chemistry. The Paleoproterozoic “Great Oxidation Event” ({\~{}}2.2 to 2.0 Ga), when atmospheric oxygen may have risen to {\textgreater}1{\%} of modern levels, and the Neoproterozoic increase in atmospheric oxygen, which followed several major glaciation events, ultimately gave rise to multicellular life and skeletal biomineralization and irreversibly transformed Earth's surface mineralogy. Biochemical processes may thus be responsible, directly or indirectly, for most of Earth's 4300 known mineral species. The stages of mineral evolution arise from three primary mechanisms: (1) the progressive separation and concentration of the elements from their original relatively uniform distribution in the pre-solar nebula; (2) an increase in range of intensive variables such as pressure, temperature, and the activities of H2O, CO2, and O2; and (3) the generation of far-from-equilibrium conditions by living systems. The sequential evolution of Earth's mineralogy from chondritic simplicity to Phanerozoic complexity introduces the dimension of geologic time to mineralogy and thus provides a dynamic alternate approach to framing, and to teaching, the mineral sciences.},

abstract = {Several Permian-Triassic boundary sections occur in various structural units within Hungary. These sections represent different facies zones of the western Palaeotethys margin. The G{\'{a}}rdony core in the NE part of the Transdanubian Range typically represents the inner ramp, while the B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny section in the B{\"{u}}kk Mountains of northern Hungary represents an outer ramp setting. The two sections have different patterns for their $\delta$13C values. The B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny section shows a continuous change towards more negative $\delta$13C values starting at the first biotic decline, followed by a sharp, quasi-symmetric negative peak at the second decline. The appearance of the $\delta$13C peak has no relationship to the lithology and occurs within a shale with low overall carbonate content, indicating that the peak is not related to diagenesis or other secondary influences. Instead, the shift and the peak reflect primary processes related to changes in environmental conditions. The continuous shift in $\delta$13C values is most probably related to a decrease in bioproductivity, whereas the sharp peak can be attributed to an addition of C strongly depleted in 13C to the ocean-atmosphere system. The most plausible model is a massive release of methane-hydrate. The quasi-symmetric pattern suggests a rapid warming-cooling cycle or physical unroofing of sediments through slope-failure and releasing methane-hydrate. The G{\'{a}}rdony-1 core shows a continuous negative $\delta$13C shift starting below the P-T boundary. However, the detailed analyses revealed a sharp $\delta$13C peak in the boundary interval, just below the major biotic decline, although its magnitude doesn't reach that observed in the B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny section. Based on careful textural examination and high-resolution stable isotope microanalyses we suggest that the suppression of the $\delta$13C peak that is common in the oolitic boundary sections is due to combined effects of condensed sedimentation, sediment reworking and erosion, as well as perhaps diagenesis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We report here detailed PGE analyses of two expanded sections from the late Permian northern and southern hemispheres that allow separate events to be distinguished and confirm a terrestrial source for the PGE. These sources are either contemporaneous seawater or older basaltic volcanics associated with the sections and the PGE were precipitated by a possible combination of development of anoxia in the oceans and post-depositional redistribution. The PGE content in sections at the Permo-Triassic boundary is the result of geochemical and lithological control on metal precipitation that is found in many other black shales throughout geological time.},

abstract = {Carbon isotopic studies from marine organic matter of the Permian-Triassic Maitai Group, New Zealand, reveal a significant 513Corg shift toward more negative values within the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. These isotopic data chemostratigraphically define the previously debated position of the Permian-Triassic boundary in the Maitai Group. The Permian-Triassic record of the Maitai Group is also important because of its high paleolatitudinal setting and the deposition at intermediate depths in the ocean (c. 400 m) within a volcanic arc-related basin. Marine Permian-Triassic strata deposited at water depths deeper than shelf areas are rare. High latitude Permian-Triassic boundary sections document a significantly larger isotopic offset across the boundary compared with lower latitude settings. Carbon isotopic values decrease rapidly by an average of 7{\%}o from homogeneous values (x -25{\%}o) in the Tramway and lower Little Ben Sandstone Formation to highly lluctuating and very depleted values (x -32{\%}o) within the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. The lowermost Big Ben and Tramway Formations are considered to be Permian in age, based on their homogeneous and comparably heavier carbon isotopic values and supported by fossil atomodesmatinid bivalves. Based on the distinct 513Corg excursion toward negative values and the concurrent onset of strong isotopic fluctuations, the Permian-Triassic boundary is placed in the lower half of the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. Very depleted 813C values in the Little Ben Sandstone Formation of-38{\%}o indicate a contribution from isotopically light methane. A possible methane source is clathrates, released by large submarine slides or warming-induced melting of permafrost. The Little Ben Sandstone Formation has been interpreted as a massive event deposit from a submarine slide (Landis 1980). This hypothesised methane release could have been in part responsible for the larger Permian-Triassic isotopic shift in high latitudes compared with low latitudes because large volumes of clathrates are trapped in continental shelves and high-latitude permafrost. },

abstract = {Santa Barbara Basin sediments host a complex network of abiotic and metabolic chemical reactions that knit together the carbon, sulfur, and iron cycles. From a 2.1-m sediment core collected in the center of the basin, we present high-resolution profiles of the concentrations and isotopic compositions of all the major species in this system: sulfate, sulfide (∑H2S), elemental sulfur (S0), pyrite, extractable organic sulfur (OS), proto-kerogen S, total organic and dissolved inorganic carbon, and total and reducible iron. Below 10 cm depth, the core is characterized by low apparent sulfate reduction rates ({\textless}0.01 mM/yr) except near the sulfate-methane transition zone. Surprisingly, pyrite forming in shallow sediments is ∼30‰ more 34S-depleted than coexisting ∑H2S in porewater. S0 has the same strongly 34S-depleted composition as pyrite where it forms near the sediment–water interface, though not at depth. This pattern is not easily explained by conventional hypotheses in which sedimentary pyrite derives from abiotic reactions with porewater ∑H2S or from the products of S0 disproportionation. Instead, we propose that pyrite formation in this environment occurs within sulfate reducing microbial aggregates or biofilms, where it reflects the isotopic composition of the immediate products of bacterial sulfate reduction. Porewater ∑H2S in Santa Barbara Basin may be more 34S-enriched than pyrite due to equilibration with relatively 34S-enriched OS. The difference between OS and pyrite $\delta$34S values would then reflect the balance between microbial sulfide formation and the abundance of exchangeable OS. Both OS and pyrite $\delta$34S records thus have the potential to provide valuable information about biogeochemical cycles and redox structure in sedimentary paleoenvironments.},

abstract = {The cause of the great Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary mass extinctions remains unknown. A crucial step in identifying the cause involves a precise timing of the mass extinction interval (MEI) in order to reconstruct the pattern of biotic evolution and the chronologic record of potential triggers. Here we present an estimate of the P-T boundary MEI duration based on astronomical tuning of multiple cyclic sedimentary records. Magnetic susceptibility data from Shangsi, southern China, provide evidence for strong 405 k.y. orbital eccentricity forcing throughout the P-T boundary interval. Radioisotope dating combined with 405 k.y. tuning provides an absolute time scale through the P-T boundary interval at unprecedented high resolution. An estimated similar to 700 k.y. duration for the MEI at Shangsi is supported by eccentricity tuned estimates of four other sections in China and Austria. In addition, at Shangsi, the onset of mass extinction occurred shortly following a coincidence of minima in the observed similar to 1.5 m.y., 405 k.y., and similar to 100 k.y. cycles. A change in the magnetic susceptibility response to astronomical forcing occurred just prior to the onset of extinction, with reduced 100-k.y.-scale cyclicity continuing into the Early Triassic for more than 2 m.y.},

abstract = {Detailed examination of the test morphology, organic layers and microstructure of G. menardii (d'Orbigny) elucidated the mode of wall construction and chamber formation. The organic layers and matrix within the test probably play an important role in the calcification process. Calcification of a new chamber wall probably starts with the secretion of 2 calcite layers on either side of the primary organic membrane (POM). These calcite layers are bounded by inner and outer organic layers formed by the inner and outer cytoplasm, respectively. Additional calcite layers are secreted between successive organic layers. The calcite layers including the calcite crust on the distal side of the POM are thicker than those on the proximal side. An inner organic lining (IOL) is the last organic layer to be formed on the inner test surface and grows thicker with age. It serves as a protective lining and may or may not aid in calcite secretion. The incipient wall may be completely calcified while still lacking pores. Numerous micropores are subsequently developed by partial resorption of the calcified wall in regions where regular pores will be formed. The pores are initially irregular in outline and occur over the entire chamber surface including the keel. Surface ridges probably reflect the direction of protoplasmic streaming on the test surface and pustules may be anchoring points for rhizopodia.},

abstract = {The Abadeh section, well-exposed in the Hambast Valley in central Iran, has long been one of the most extensively studied sections because of its continuous carbonate-dominated strata from Lower Permian to Lower Triassic. However, biostratigraphy and correlation with the equivalent sequences in other regions remain controversial. In this paper both carbon isotope excursion ($\delta$13Ccarb) and strontium isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr) based on bulk carbonate samples have been measured to serve as chemostratigraphical proxies to estimate the three different chronostratigraphical boundaries in the Lopingian at the Abadeh section, including the Permian-Triassic Event (PTEB), the Guadalupian-Lopingian (GLB), and the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundaries (WCB). These three boundaries are important for understanding the marine biological evolution around this critical interval. Based on the $\delta$13C excursions, the rising trend of 87Sr/86Sr and the value around 0.7073, and the occurrence of microbialite beds, the Permian-Triassic event boundary (=Bed 25 at the Meishan section) is suggested at -0.5m below the base of the main microbialite bed. The GLB is suggested at -46.5m based on the position of the minor $\delta$13Ccarb negative depletion, coupled with the values between 0.7069 and 0.7070 of 87Sr/86Sr and its beginning point of the rising trend, which is above the lowest value 0.7068 of 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the Paleozoic. The relationship between section thickness and their high-resolution depositional age (projecting age) is interpolated for the whole Lopingian using locally weighted regression scatter plot smoother (LOWESS) of strontium isotopic ratio. Based on the negative $\delta$13C excursion and the value 0.7072 of 87Sr/86Sr ratio, the WCB is estimated at 1m above the lithologic boundary between Unit 6 and Unit 7, much lower than the boundary defined by previous conodont biostratigraphy, but similar to other index fossils. This boundary is projected as ca. 254.6Ma in 87Sr/86Sr-age projecting model and is close to zircon U/Pb dating age from South China. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

Different lines of evidence indicate that regime shifts occur when the climate or biosphere transgresses a tipping point. Whether human activities will trigger such a global event in the near future is uncertain, due to critical knowledge gaps. In particular, we lack understanding of how regime shifts propagate across scales, and whether local or regional tipping points can lead to global transitions. The ongoing disruption of ecosystems and climate, combined with unprecedented breakdown of isolation by human migration and trade, highlights the need to operate within safe planetary boundaries.},

abstract = {The modern shallow-platform, calcium-carbonate–dominated sediments of the Florida Keys (Florida Bay and Atlantic reef tract) are diverse in their biological, sedimentological, and geochemical properties. Sites of intense bioturbation and thick seagrass cover are pervasive within Florida Bay and are often characterized by appreciable early diagenetic aragonite dissolution. Additional, less common sites show atypical diagenetic profiles that suggest strong reworking and/or very rapid deposition of the upper sediment layer extending to a depth of at least 20 cm. Diagenesis in these seagrass-free areas is dominated by rapid burial of labile organic matter that would otherwise be degraded aerobically under conditions of slower burial. Correspondingly, these oozy, water-rich sediments display anomalously high rates of microbial decomposition as recorded in 35S-sulfate reduction rates and patterns of sulfate depletion, high dissolved sulfide concentrations in excess of several millimolar (mM), and elevated alkalinities. Unlike many sites in Florida Bay where solute concentrations suggest volumetrically significant net dissolution of metastable carbonate phases, dramatic increases in carbonate alkalinity from organic matter oxidation during bacterial sulfate reduction support net precipitation of CaCO3 in the highly reactive surface layer. This early carbonate mineralization is indicated by measured depletions in Ca approaching 4 mM relative to overlying seawater. Geochemical signatures of sediment reworking or rapid sedimentation are corroborated by porosity trends; visual evaluations, including X-radiography; and an interval of essentially constant 210Pb activity. Rapid burial within the reactive layer gives rise to restricted-system diagenetic behavior that is recorded in the sulfur isotope compositions of dissolved sulfate and sulfide. Nevertheless, despite strong 34S enrichments in the pore-water sulfate and clear evidence for diagenetic calcium carbonate precipitation, carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) trapped within the muds (at concentrations from ∼2400 to 4200 ppm) preserves the original 34S/32S ratio of the overlying seawater. Such preservation of the $\delta$34S of seawater sulfate in bulk lime mud samples—even in the presence of appreciable diagenetic overprinting—confirms the broad utility of the CAS approach in reconstructing ancient ocean chemistry.},

abstract = {Pyrite framboids are densely packed, generally spherical aggregates of submicron-sized pyrite crystals. In this study, a survey was made of framboid size distributions in recently deposited sediments from euxinic (Black Sea; Framvaren Fjord, Norway; Pettaquamscutt River Estuary, Rhode Island, USA), dysoxic (Peru Margin), and oxic (Wallops Island, Virginia, USA; Great Salt Marsh, Delaware, USA) environments. Pyrite framboids in sediments of modern euxinic basins are on average smaller and less variable in size than those of sediments underlying dysoxic or oxic water columns. Down-core trends indicate framboid size distribution is a sediment property fixed very early during anoxic diagenesis, generally within the top few centimeters of burial. Size distributions in modern sediments are comparable with those in ancient sedimentary rocks, evidence that framboid size is preserved through advanced stages of diagenesis and lithification. It is proposed that where secondary pyrite growth is limited, as to preserve primary pyrite textures, framboid size distribution may be used to indicate whether fine-grained sedimentary rocks were deposited under oxic or anoxic conditions. The Crystal Size Distribution Theory relates framboid size to growth time and rate. On the basis of this theory, the characteristic smaller sizes of framboids in sediments of modem euxinic basins reflect shorter average growth times relative to oxic or dysoxic environments. In euxinic environments, framboid nucleation and growth occurs within anoxic water columns, and growth times are, on average, shorter because of hydrodynamic effects than when framboid nucleation and growth occurs within anoxic sediment porewaters underlying oxic water columns. A maximum framboid growth time of 0.4 years is indicated for framboids forming in the water columns of euxinic basins.},

abstract = {Early Triassic oceans were characterized by deposition of a number of "anachronistic facies", including microbialites, seafloor carbonate cement fans, and giant ooids. Giant ooids were particularly prevalent in Lower Triassic sections across South China and exhibit unusual features that may provide insights into marine environmental conditions following the end-Permian mass extinction. The section at Moyang (Guizhou Province) contains abundant giant ooids ranging in size between 2 and 6mm (maximum 12mm) and exhibiting various cortical structures, including regular, deformed, compound, regenerated and "domed". Preservation of ooid cortical structure is generally good as indicated by petrographic observations, and trace element and carbon isotope analyses suggest that diagenesis occurred in a closed diagenetic system. All ooids exhibit fine concentric laminae, frequently alternating between light-colored coarsely crystalline and dark-colored finely crystalline layers probably reflecting variation in organic content or original mineralogy. Under scanning electron microscope, biomineralized filaments or biofilms and tiny carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) crystals are commonly found in the finely crystalline layers. We infer that the precipitation of CFA was related to adsorption of P via microbial activity on the surfaces of ooids following episodic incursions of deep waters rich in CO2, H2S and phosphate into shallow-marine environments. Giant ooid precipitation may have been promoted in shallow ramp settings during these events by increased watermass agitation and supersaturation with respect to CaCO3, as well as reduced carbonate removal rates through biotic skeletal formation. Spatio-temporal distribution data reveal that giant ooids were widespread in the Tethyan region during the Early Triassic, and that they were most abundant immediately after the end-Permian crisis and disappeared gradually as metazoans repopulated marine environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The term 'stromatolite' was proposed by Kalkowsky (1908. Z. dt. geol. Ges. 60, 68-125) for structures he discovered in the carbonates of the Lower Triassic Buntsandstein of the Harz Mountains in central Germany. We have re-examined these localities to clarify Kalkowsky's descriptions and to deduce the environmental conditions of stromatolitic growth. The Lower Buntsandstein was deposited in a closed lacustrine basin, the Central European Permo-Triassic Basin. The depositional environment was a playa lake with variable salinity. In the centre of the basin oolite beds are intercalated in the mainly siliciclastic succession which is composed of {\textgreater}20 fining upward cycles thought to have been produced by climatic variations. Stromatolites occur almost exclusively on the surface of oolite beds. Stromatolitic structures consist of millimetre-thick laminated crusts and centimetre-high branching columnar forms. Smaller and bigger ({\textgreater}2 m high) domes are composed of secondary order columns and intercalated crusts. Occasionally, upper surfaces of the domes are pitted due to syndepositional dissolution. Despite of the overall intense sparitization, two groups of stromatolitic microstructures can be distinguished, spongy-fenestrate and fan-like fabrics. The spongy-fenestrate fabric is similar to that one caused by the recent cyanobacteria Phormidium, Calothrix and Dichothrix, and the fan-like fabric to Rivularia. Laminated crusts called stromatoid by Kalkowsky are interpreted as being of cement origin and formed by quick precipitation. The change from columnar to domical forms may reflect changes of hydrodynamic conditions. Clear photoautotrophism suggests that cyanobacteria or eukaryotes were the dominant organisms involved in the formation of Kalkowsky's stromatolites. Influx of ooids or siliciclastic mud interrupted or terminated the stromatolitic growth. The morphology, growth pattern and fabrics of stromatolites were most likely controlled by ecological factors which all seem to be related to the general hydro-climatic evolution of the Lower Buntsandstein.

abstract = {Precipitation of inorganic calcium carbonate is a common occurrence in both modern and ancient marine environments. However, synsedimentary growth of large ({\textgreater}5-10 cm) crystalline carbonate cements directly onto the sea floor has been thought to be limited to the Proterozoic, when seawaters were highly oversaturated with calcium carbonate compared to average Phanerozoic values. Outer shelf to slope deposits of the Lower Triassic Union Wash Formation in east-central California, deposited in oxygen-restricted settings, contain crystalline calcium carbonate cements that appear to have grown directly on the sea floor. Paleoenvironmental analyses indicate that these large calcium carbonate cements grew under conditions that were similar to those proposed for the precipitation of inorganic calcite in the Black Sea. Sulfate reduction of organic matter led to an increase in the amount of bicarbonate ion in deep waters and a concomitant increase in Sigma CO 2 and alkalinity. Mixing with surface waters led to CO 2 degassing, and precipitation of cements from waters supersaturated with calcium carbonate. The presence of these cements and associated facies thus provides evidence of harsh environmental conditions in the Early Triassic at the regional level, which may have acted in concert with biotic effects of the end-Permian mass extinction, as well as similar deleterious conditions (e.g., shelf anoxia) in other regions, to produce a prolonged as well as temporally and geographically variable biotic recovery from this mass extinction.},

abstract = {The end-Permian extinction event was the most pronounced biotic and ecological crisis in the history of the Earth. It is assumed that over 80{\%} of marine genera disappeared, and that this event had a major impact on the evolution of marine organisms. The impact of this event on terrestrial biota is poorly known and a matter of controversial discussions. In contrast to the fundamental changes in marine fauna most major groups of plants range from the Late Palaeozoic into the Mesozoic. Consequently the impact of the end-Permian extinction event on the evolution of plants was often regarded as minor. However, major changes in the composition of the plant communities have been documented and a number of catastrophic scenarios have been envisioned - including the almost total destruction of plant ecosystems. Based on expanded sections from the Southern Barents Sea (Northern Norway) we trace mid-latitudinal terrestrial ecosystems across the Permo-Triassic transition with a time resolution in the order of 10kyr, based on a high resolution Corg-isotope stratigraphy. Our results show that the floral turnovers are linked with major changes in the C-isotope record and hence with global carbon cycling. The palynological records document the successive steps in the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems. After gradual changes during the latest Permian, plant ecosystems suffered from a major environmental perturbation leading to a rapid turnover from gymnosperm dominated ecosystems to assemblages dominated by lycopods. The dominance of the lycopods, expressed in a spore-spike, represents a relatively short-lived event in the order of 10kyr. This perturbation of the terrestrial ecosystems preceded the globally recognized negative $\delta$13Corg isotope spike by up to 100kyr. It coincides with a first end-Permian negative shift of the C-isotope curve and was probably induced by a first major perturbation of the chemistry of the atmosphere, related to the onset of the volcanic activity of the Siberian Traps. Gymnosperms recovered prior to the major isotopic shift. The fast recovery of terrestrial ecosystem explains why all major plant groups survived the end-Permian extinction event while the majority of marine organisms were wiped out. The concordance of pattern of the $\delta$13Corg in globally distributed marine and terrestrial sequences enables us to link turnovers in the terrestrial environment with marine extinction events. It demonstrates that the demise and the onset of the recovery of the terrestrial ecosystems was a global phenomenon and occurred prior to the major isotopic shift. The successive negative shifts in $\delta$13Corg isotope values are thought to reflect CO2 input into the atmosphere by multiphase volcanic activity (Siberian Traps) or other consecutive events (e.g. methane release). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Correlation of stratigraphic sections from different continents suggests a worldwide interruption of carbonate sedimentation at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, which coincided with one of the most catastrophic mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic. Both events are linked by a vulcanogenic maximum of carbon dioxide, which led to a temporary undersaturation of sea water with respect to aragonite and calcite and a corresponding suppression of carbonate sedimentation including nonpreservation of calcareous skeletons. Besides the frequently cited climatic effect of enhanced carbon dioxide, lowering the saturation state of sea water with respect to calcium carbonate was an additional driving force of the end-Triassic mass extinction, which chiefly affected organisms with thick aragonitic or high-magnesium calcitic skeletons. Replacement of aragonite by calcite, as found in the shells of epifaunal bivalves, was an evolutionary response to this condition.},

abstract = {The Paleozoic Middle East terranes, neighboring the present-day Arabian and Levant plates, are shown by most authors to consist of ten major tectonic units: (1 and 2) the Helmand and Farah terranes of Afghanistan, southwest Pakistan and southeast Turkmenistan; (3 to 6) the Alborz, Central Iran (Lut, Yazd and Tabas) and Sanandaj-Sirjan terranes of Iran, and Northwest Iran (possibly extending into eastern Turkey); (7 and 8) the Pontides and Taurides terranes of Turkey; and (9 and 10) the Greater and Lesser Caucasus terranes between the Caspian and Black seas (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and southwest Russia). Published plate-tectonic reconstructions indicate that all ten terranes may have broken off from either: (1) the Gondwana Supercontinent in the mid-Silurian as part of the Hun Superterrane; or (2) the Pangea Supercontinent during the mid-Permian - Triassic as part of the Cimmeria Superterrane. To the north of Gondwana and Pangea, three successively younger Tethyan oceans evolved: (1) Proto-Tethys (Cambrian - Devonian); (2) Paleo-Tethys (mid-Silurian - Mesozoic); and (3) Neo-Tethys (mid-Permian - Cenozoic). Two regional Paleozoic unconformities in the Arabian Plate are generally linked to major regional-scale structural events, and commonly correlated to the Caledonian and Hercynian orogenies. These orogenies took place many thousands of kilometers away from the Arabian Plate and are considered unlikely causes for these unconformities. Instead, the breakaway of the Hun and Cimmeria superterranes are considered as alternative near-field tectonic sources. The older unconformity (middle Paleozoic event), represented by a mid-Silurian to Middle Devonian hiatus in North Arabia (Iraq and Syria), reflects an episode of epeirogenic uplift, which might be related to the mid-Silurian rift of the Hun Superterrane. The younger mid-Carboniferous Arabia-wide angular unconformity involved compressional faulting and epeirogenic uplift, and might be related to the earliest phase of subduction by the Paleo-Tethyan crust beneath Cimmeria (Sanandaj-Sirjan and nearby regions) before it broke off. Based on our review and regional considerations, we assign the Helmand, Farah, Central Iran, Alborz, Sanandaj-Sirjan, Northwest Iran, Lesser Caucasus, Taurides and Pontides to Cimmeria, whereas the Greater Caucasus is considered Hunic.},

However, contemporaneous glaciations have been hypothesized based on sequence stratigraphic evidence for rapid sea-level oscillation and oxygen isotope excursions in records generated from carbonates of questionable preservation and/or of low resolution. We present new oxygen isotope records for the mid-Cenomanian Demerara Rise that are of much higher resolution than previously available, taken from both planktic and benthic foraminifers, and utilizing only extremely well preserved glassy foraminifers. Our records show no evidence of glaciation, calling into question the hypothesized ice sheets and rendering the origin of inferred rapid sea-level oscillations enigmatic. Simple mass-balance calculations demonstrate that this Cretaceous sea-level paradox is unlikely to be explained by hidden ice sheets existing below the limit of $\delta$18O detection.},

abstract = {The biggest mass extinction of the past 600 million years (My), the end-Permian event (251My ago), witnessed the loss of as much as 95{\%} of all species on Earth. Key questions for biologists concern what combination of environmental changes could possibly have had such a devastating effect, the scale and pattern of species loss, and the nature of the recovery. New studies on dating the event, contemporary volcanic activity, and the anatomy of the environmental crisis have changed our perspectives dramatically in the past five years. Evidence on causation is equivocal, with support for either an asteroid impact or mass volcanism, but the latter seems most probable. The extinction model involves global warming by 6°C and huge input of light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system from the eruptions, but especially from gas hydrates, leading to an ever-worsening positive-feedback loop, the ‘runaway greenhouse'.},

The overall variation in Zn isotopic composition, as determined by multiple-collector, magnetic-sector, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, was found to be on the order of 1‰ (expressed in $\delta$

                        66Zn signal showed two periodicities of 35.2 and 21.2 ka. We suggest that the latter is caused by the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation. The periodogram exhibits a minimum at 41.1 ka, thus showing that the Zn isotopic composition is independent of the obliquity in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The range of $\delta$
                        66Zn values observed for the carbonate fraction of ODP 849 overlaps with the range observed for Fe-Mn nodules in the world's oceans, which suggests that seawater/carbonate Zn isotope fractionation is weak. We therefore assume that most of the Zn isotope variability is a result of the selective entrainment of the light isotopes by organic matter in the surface ocean. The ODP 849 $\delta$
                        66Zn record seems to follow the changes in the insolation cycles. Changes in the late summer/fall equatorial insolation modulate the intensity of the equatorial upwelling, hence the mixing between deep and surface waters. We propose that during decreased summer/fall equatorial insolation, when a steep thermocline can develop (El Ni{\~{n}}o-like conditions), the surface waters cannot be replenished by deep waters and become depleted in the lighter Zn isotopes by biological activity, thus resulting in the progressive increase of the $\delta$

abstract = {Permian–Triassic boundary sections record the most severe mass extinction event in geological history. However, there is a long-standing controversy of whether bolide impact and/or basaltic flood volcanism triggered the mass extinction. Platinum-group elements (PGEs) are enriched in most extraterrestrial materials, but highly depleted in the terrestrial crust materials. We analyzed Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt and Pd in a set of samples from the global stratotype section and point (GSSP) of the Permian–Triassic boundary at Meishan, China, using isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) and nickel sulfide fire assay (NiS-FA) combined with Te coprecipitation. The samples have no Ir anomaly (5–53 pg/g), and their PGE patterns normalized to chondrites are highly fractionated with Ir/Pd ratios of 0.02–0.03 × CI, distinct from most extraterrestrial materials. In contrast, these patterns are closely parallel to those of the Siberian and probably Emeishan flood basalts, suggestive of possible sources of PGEs from the basalts. The abundances of PGEs increase in order of the pyrite lamina on the top of bed 24, bed 25 and bed 26, and then decrease to bed 28, probably indicative of a maximum eruption of the flood basalts during deposition of bed 26. The new data favor massive volcanism, rather than extraterrestrial impact, as a major cause of the Permian–Triassic boundary mass extinction.},

abstract = {The Karoo Basin of South Africa was one of several contemporaneous intracratonic basins in southwestern Gondwana that became active in the Permo-Carboniferous (280 Ma) and continued to accumulate sediments until the earliest Jurassic, 100 million years later. At their maximum areal extent, during the early Permian, these basins covered some 4.5 million km2. The present outcrop area of Karoo rocks in southern Africa is about 300 000 km2 with a maximum thickness of some 8000 m. The economic importance of these sediments lies in the vast reserves of coal within the Ecca Group rocks of northern and eastern Transvaal and Natal, South Africa. Large reserves of sandstone-hosted uranium and molybdenum have been proven within the Beaufort Group rocks of the southern Karoo trough, although they are not mineable in the present market conditions. Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the major stratigraphic units of the Karoo succession in South Africa demonstrates the changes in depositional style caused by regional and localized tectonism within the basin. These depocentres were influenced by a progressive aridification of climate which was primarily caused by the northward drift of southwestern Gondwana out of a polar climate and accentuated by the meteoric drying effect of the surrounding land masses. Changing palaeoenvironments clearly influenced the rate and direction of vertebrate evolution in southern Gondwana as evidenced by the numerous reptile fossils, including dinosaurs, which are found in the Karoo strata of South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe. During the Late Carboniferous the southern part of Gondwana migrated over the South Pole resulting in a major ice sheet over the early Karoo basin and surrounding highlands. Glacial sedimentation in upland valleys and on the lowland shelf resulted in the Dwyka Formation at the base of the Karoo Sequence. After glaciation, an extensive shallow sea covered the gently subsiding shelf, fed by large volumes of meltwater. Marine clays and muds accumulated under cool climatic conditions (Lower Ecca Group) including the distinctive Mesosaurus-bearing carbonaceous shales of the Whitehill Formation. Subduction of the palaeo-Pacific plate reslted in an extensive chain of mountains which deformed and later truncated the southern rim of the main Karoo Basin. Material derived from these "Gondwanide" mountains as well as from the granitic uplands to the north-east, accumulated in large deltas that prograded into the Ecca sea (Upper Ecca Group). The relatively cool and humid climate promoted thick accumulations of peat on the fluvial and delta plains which now constitute the major coal reserves of southern Africa. As the prograding deltas coalesced, fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Beaufort Group were laid down on broad gently subsiding alluvial plains. The climate by this time (Late Permian) had warmed to become semi-arid with highly seasonal rainfall. Vegetation alongside the meander belts and semi-permanent lakes supported a diverse reptilian fauna dominated by therapsids or "mammal-like reptiles". Pulses of uplift in the southern source areas combined with possible orographic effects resulted in the progadation of two coarse-grained alluvial fans into the central parts of the basin (Katberg Sandstone Member and Molteno Formation). In the upper Karoo Sequence, progressive aridification and tectonic deformation of the basin through the late Triassic and early Jurassic led to the accumulation, in four separate depositories, of "redbeds" which are interpreted as fluvial and flood-fan, playa and dune complexes (Elliot Formation). This eventually gave way to westerly wind-dominated sedimentation that choked the remaining depositories with fine-grained dune sand. The interdune areas were damp and occasionally flooded and provided a habitat for small dinosaurs and the earliest mammals. During this time (Early Jurassic), basinwide volcanic activity began as a precursor to the break-up of Gondwana in the late Jurassic and continued until the early Cretaceous. This extrusion of extensive flood basalts (Drakensberg Group) onto the Clarens landscape eventually brought Karoo sedimentation to a close. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Hemipelagic nodular limestones are a widespread facies in the Triassic of the Tethys, often considered as being deposited at rather constant sedimentation rates. The aim of this paper is to investigate the sedimentation rate variability in a case-study from the Middle Triassic of the Dolomites, northern Italy, and to suggest possible causes. The nodular cherty limestones of the Livinallongo Fm. and correlated units were studied in four stratigraphic sections and compared to classical successions from the literature. Correlations between sections are based on ammonoid biostratigraphy and tephra stratigraphy. Correlation highlighted conspicuous changes in sedimentation rates through time and between sections, associated with sedimentological evidence of deep-water aragonite dissolution. Deep-water dissolution is believed to have resulted in small hiatuses and in a bias of ammonoid assemblages towards taxa with more resistant shells. Carbonate petrography and geochemistry provide evidence of differential diagenesis of the Livinallongo Fm. Carbonate nodules were lithified at the watersediment interface, and their C isotope composition is regarded as a proxy of the d13C of Middle Triassic bottom seawater. The onset of nodular cherty limestones, occurring contemporaneously at the basin scale, and the coeval carbonate platform drowning events are tentatively explained by the inflow and local upwelling of cool deep water from Panthalassa into the western Tethys.},

abstract = {High precision oxygen isotope analyses were made of phosphate extracted from 17 samples of nektonic and benthic fish debris sampled across the stratigraphic Cretaceous—Tertiary boundary in northern Morocco. A refinement of the silver phosphate method was used to isolate phosphate from biogenic materials. Measured $\delta$18O values of 18.6–20.5‰ are interpreted as reflecting high-resolution thermal variations that affected the ocean water column of the western Tethys. The warm (27°C) water masses that characterized Maastrichtian times underwent rapid cooling and stabilized at an average temperature of 19°C during the Dano-Montian and Thanetian. This period of constant and cool temperature was followed by a relatively rapid but more gradual warming to about 25°C achieved in the Middle Ypresian. Significant small shifts in $\delta$18O values between nektonic and benthic fauna recorded only during the stages of rapid warming or cooling may correspond to averaged thermal differences within the water column that developed in response to global climatic changes. The indicated temperature distribution could have been caused by thermal changes in the atmosphere rather than some signal carried by deep ocean currents. The oxygen isotope data coupled with previous measurements of REE and ϵNd(T) on the same samples support the suggestion that paleo-Pacific westward currents progressed as far as the northwestern part of the African platform at the end of the Cretaceous period.},

abstract = {The continuity through the past 300 million years of key tropical sediment types, namely coals, evaporites, reefs and carbonates, is examined. Physical controls for their geographical distributions are related to the Hadley cell circulation, and its effects on rainfall and ocean circulation. Climate modelling studies are reviewed in this context, as are biogeographical studies of key fossil groups. Low-latitude peats and coals represent everwet climates related to the Intertropical Convergence Zone near the Equator, as well as coastal diurnal rainfall systems elsewhere in the tropics and subtropics. The incidence of tropical coals and rainforests through time is variable, being least common during the interval of Pangean monsoonal climates. Evaporites represent the descending limbs of the Hadley cells and are centred at 10° to 40° north and south in latitudes that today show an excess of evaporation over precipitation. These deposits coincide with the deserts as well as seasonally rainy climates, and their latitudinal ranges seem to have been relatively constant through time. Reefs also can be related to the Hadley circulation. They thrive within the regions of clear water associated with broad areas of downwelling which are displaced toward the western portions of tropical oceans. These dynamic features are ultimately driven by the subtropical high-pressure cells which are the surface signature of the subsiding branches of the Hadley circulation. Carbonates occupy the same areas, but extend into higher latitudes in regions where terrestrial surface gradients are low and clastic runoff from the land is minimal. We argue that the palaeo-latitudinal record of all these climate-sensitive sediment types is broadly similar to their environments and latitudes of formation today, implying that dynamic effects of atmospheric and oceanic circulation control their distribution, rather than temperature gradients that would expand or contract through time.},

abstract = {Brachiopod miniaturization is both the reduction in size of individuals of a species over time, and where one brachiopod fauna dominated by larger individuals was replaced by a brachiopod fauna dominated by smaller individuals over time. This paper investigates this phenomenon prior to and during the end-Permian crisis in a deep water setting in South China, based on precise measurements of brachiopod body size and on the abundance and diversity of brachiopod species. The process of miniaturization near the Permian-Triassic boundary in deep water environments is characterized by: (1) Larger species, including Martinia sp., Costatumulus dongpanensis, and Anidanthus mucronata, reduced in average body size and abundance over time towards the end-Permian brachiopod extinction event. (2) Small species, including Attenuatella mengi and Spinomarginifera semicircridge, showed a mixed response with either no size change, or a reduction in average body size, while these species increased in abundance over time, indicating they were less sensitive to the stressed environmental setting. (3) Both the total abundance and the diversity of this brachiopod fauna decreased over time towards the end-Permian crisis. Regression, an increased input of terrestrial material and productivity decline are considered to all have contributed to brachiopod miniaturization, based on the biotic replacement and changes in sea-water chemistry. Among these factors, the fall in sea level is perhaps the primary factor, and led to a decline in productivity and an increased input of terrestrial material into the marine setting. 2007.},

abstract = {Prominent negative delta13C excursions characterize several past intervals of abrupt (2.5per mille sign drop across the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) ca. 55.5 Ma, command our attention because they lack explanation with conventional models for global carbon cycling. Increasingly, Earth scientists have argued that they signify massive release of CH4 from marine gas hydrates, although typically without considering the underlying process or the ensuing ramifications of such an interpretation. At the most basic level, a large, dynamic `gas hydrate capacitor' stores and releases 13C-depleted carbon at rates linked to external conditions such as deep ocean temperature. The capacitor contains three internal reservoirs: dissolved gas, gas hydrate, and free gas. Carbon enters and leaves these reservoirs through microbial decomposition of organic matter, anaerobic oxidation of CH4 in shallow sediment, and seafloor gas venting; carbon cycles between these reservoirs through several processes, including fluid flow, precipitation and dissolution of gas hydrate, and burial. Numerical simulations show that simple gas hydrate capacitors driven by inferred changes in bottom water warming during the PETM can generate a global delta13C excursion that mimics observations. The same modeling extended over longer time demonstrates that variable CH4 fluxes to and from gas hydrates can partly explain other delta13C excursions, rapid and slow, large and small, negative and positive. Although such modeling is rudimentary (because processes and variables in modern and ancient gas hydrate systems remain poorly constrained), acceptance of a vast, externally regulated gas hydrate capacitor forces us to rethink delta13C records and the operation of the global carbon cycle throughout time.},

abstract = {Carbonate carbon-isotope values from the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary section at Seis/Siusi (Southern Alps, Italy) show a trend similar to that in numerous other P-T boundary sections worldwide. Values decrease from 3.2 ‰ (V-PDB) in the upper Bellerophon Limestone Formation (Late Permian) to a minimum of -1.7 ‰ in the lower Mazzin Member. This minimum may represent the P-T boundary. The overall declining carbon-isotope trend is interrupted by a ca. 1 ‰ positive excursion in the higher Tesero Oolite Horizon. This positive peak is located at a higher lithostratigraphic level than a comparable peak in the adjacent Pufels section, which suggests that the Tesero Oolite Horizon in the Seis section is stratigraphically slightly older than in the Pufels section, and this is also suggested by palaeomagnetic correlation. It is therefore concluded that the base of the Tesero Oolite Horizon does not reflect a synchronous "current event" but is slightly diachronous, a result that was previously shown by biostratigraphic correlation. Nevertheless, this suggestion should be verified by further detailed litho-, magneto- and chemostratigraphic analysis of other P-T sections in the Southern Alps. {\textcopyright} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {The end Permian negative [delta]13C excursion is well known but its cause and chronology are still in question. In an attempt to decipher the timing and reasons for this strong decrease, we established high-resolution sedimentological, biostratigraphical and carbonate carbon isotopic studies in four sections in Iran (Abadeh, Shareeza, Zal and Djulfa) and two in Oman (Wadi Sahtan). The position of the sections on two different margins of the Neotethys has allowed us to distinguish between local and global signals. This high-resolution chemostratigraphy, tested for isochrony on the basis of an updated high-resolution conodont and ammonoid biostratigraphy, allows the discrimination of nine successive isotopic events (IE 0-8) for the Permian-Triassic Boundary Interval (PTBI). The negative excursion of the PTBI has been separated into four distinct parts. A first drop (IE 0) occurs in the Late Wuchiapingian with an amplitude of around 1.3[per mille sign]. A second decrease begins (IE 1-2) at the base of the Dzhulfites ammonoid beds (Changhsingian) and continues gradually until the extinction event (top jolfensis conodont interval, without important second-order variations. Its amplitude varies between 1.5[per mille sign] and 2.8[per mille sign] and its duration has been estimated around 2.2 Ma, revealing a non-catastrophic phenomenon. The lower meishanensis-praeparvus conodont Zone records stationary to slightly increasing values (IE 3). The interval of the curve after the extinction event, between the upper meishanensis-praeparvus Zone and the base of the I. isarcica Zone, records numerous second-order variations (IE 4-7). Its amplitude is of 1.2-3.1[per mille sign]. These second-order variations are correlatable in Iran but with some uncertainty with Oman. Poor correlation of these small peaks with others published sections might be due to a higher sensitivity to local perturbations and a lower buffer capacity of the whole ocean. We assume that the processes leading to the extinction event also caused the isotopic decrease before the extinction level with a maximal amplitude of only 2.8[per mille sign]. This allows consideration of some possible mechanisms that were rejected as unrealistic to cause a 4-6[per mille sign] excursion.},

abstract = {The recent proliferation of stratigraphic studies of ??13C variation in carbonates and organic C in later Neoproterozoic and basal Cambrian successions (??? 850-530 Ma) indicates a strong oscillating trend in the C-isotopic composition of surface seawater. Alone, this trend does not adequately characterize discrete intervals in Neoproterozoic time. However, integrated with the vectorial signals provided by fossils and Sr-isotopic variations, C isotope chemostratigraphy facilitates the interbasinal correlation of later Neoproterozoic successions. Results of these studies are evaluated in terms of four stratigraphic intervals: (1) the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary, (2) the post-Varanger terminal Proterozoic, (3) the late Cryogenian, and (4) the early Cryogenian. Where biostratigraphic or radiometric data constrain the age of Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences, secular variations in C and Sr isotopes can provide a level of stratigraphic resolution exceeding that that provided by fossils alone. Isotopic data place strong constraints on the chemical evolution of seawater, linking it to major tectonic and paleoclimatic events. They also provide a biogeochemical framework for the understanding of the initial radiation of macroscopic metazoans, which is associated stratigraphically, and perhaps causally, with a global increase in the burial of organic C and a concomitant rise of atmospheric O2. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Quantifying the rates of biogeochemical processes in marine sediments is essential for understanding global element cycles and climate change. Because organic matter degradation is the engine behind benthic dynamics, deciphering the impact that various forces have on this process is central to determining the evolution of the Earth system. Therefore, recent developments in the quantitative modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are critically reviewed. The first part of the review synthesizes the main chemical, biological and physical factors that control organic matter degradation in sediments while the second part provides a general review of the mathematical formulations used to model these processes and the third part evaluates their application over different spatial and temporal scales. Key transport mechanisms in sedimentary environments are summarized and the mathematical formulation of the organic matter degradation rate law is described in detail. The roles of enzyme kinetics, bioenergetics, temperature and biomass growth in particular are highlighted. Alternative model approaches that quantify the degradation rate constant are also critically compared. In the third part of the review, the capability of different model approaches to extrapolate organic matter degradation rates over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales is assessed. In addition, the structure, functions and parameterization of more than 250 published models of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are analyzed. The large range of published model parameters illustrates the complex nature of organic matter dynamics, and, thus, the limited transferability of these parameters from one site to another. Compiled model parameters do not reveal a statistically significant correlation with single environmental characteristics such as water depth, deposition rate or organic matter flux. The lack of a generic framework that allows for model parameters to be constrained in data-poor areas seriously limits the quantification of organic matter degradation on a global scale. Therefore, we explore regional patterns that emerge from the compiled more than 250 organic matter rate constants and critically discuss them in their environmental context. This review provides an interdisciplinary view on organic matter degradation in marine sediments. It contributes to an improved understanding of global patterns in benthic organic matter degradation, and helps identify outstanding questions and future directions in the modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

abstract = {The nitrogen isotopic composition of time-series sediment trap samples, dissolved NO3- and surficial sediments was determined in three regions along the margin of the eastern North Pacific: Monterey Bay, San Pedro Basin, and the Gulf of California (Carmen and Guaymas Basins). Complex physical regimes are present in all three areas, and each is influenced seasonally by coastal upwelling. Nevertheless, sediment trap material evidently records the isotopic composition of new nitrogen sources, since average delta(15)N is generally indistinguishable from delta(15)N values for subsurface NO3-. Surficial sediments are also very similar to the average delta(15)N value of the sediment traps, being within 1 parts per thousand. This difference in delta(15)N between trap material and sediment is much less than the previously observed 4 parts per thousand, difference for the deep sea. Better organic matter preservation at our margin sites is a likely explanation, which may be due to either low bottom O-2 concentrations or higher organic matter input to the sediments. All sites have delta(15)N for sub-euphotic zone NO3- (8-10 parts per thousand) substantially elevated from the oceanic average (4.5-5 parts per thousand). This isotopic enrichment is a result of denitrification in suboxic subsurface waters (Gulf of California) or northward transport of denitrification influenced water (Monterey Bay and San Pedro Basin). Our results therefore suggest that downcore delta(15)N data, depending on site location, would record the intensity of denitrification and the transport of its isotopic signature along the California margin. Temporal variations in delta(15)N for the sediment traps do appear to respond to upwelling or convective injections of NO3- to surface waters as a result of isotopic fractionation during phytoplankton uptake. Overall, though, the coupling between NO3- injection, delta(15)N, and flux is looser than previously observed for the open-ocean, most likely the result of the smaller time/space scales of the events. III the Gulf of California, wintertime convective mixing/upwelling does produce distinct delta(15)N minima co-occurring with particle flux maxima. Interannual variations are apparent in this region when these wintertime delta(15)N minima fail to occur during El Nino conditions. There appears to be a positive relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly and annual average delta(15)N. One explanation calls for hydrographic changes altering the delta(15)N of subeuphotic zone NO3-. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Detailed measurements of two Permian-Triassic boundary sections at Guryul Ravine and Pahlgam in Kashmir indicate continuous sedimentation across the boundary, though with a marked change from shallow storm-influenced shelf to deeper shelf below wave base. Successive shell beds through the 2.5-m-thick transitional latest Permian section at Guryul formed as in situ accumulations with little sign of either erosional breaks or condensation. Faunal change takes place gradually in the late Permian transition beds, as elsewhere in the Tethyan sections. There is no major event layer at the Permian-Triassic boundary, and little evidence for dysaerobic conditions. Both the Kashmir and East Greenland Permian-Triassic sections have sedimentation rates that are orders of magnitude greater than at the condensed Meishan reference section. They show that the end-Permian extinction was associated with transgression but not with immediate onset of anoxic conditions.

abstract = {A palaeomagnetic study of Late Permian to Early Jurassic rocks from the Alborz and Sanandaj-Sirjan zones in Iran and a compilation of selected palaeopoles from the Carboniferous to the present provide an updated history of the motion of the Iranian block within the Tethys Ocean. The Iran assemblage, part of Gondwana during the Palaeozoic, rifted away by the end of the Permian. The authors ascertain the southern-hemisphere palaeoposition of Iran at that time using magnetostratigraphy and show that it was situated close to Arabia, near to its relative position today. A northward transit of this block during the Triassic is shown, with an estimated expansion rate of the Neotethyan ridge of 100-140 km Myr-1. The northward convergence with respect to Eurasia ended during the Ladinian (Middle Triassic), and is marked by a collision in the northern hemisphere with the Turan platform, which was the southern margin of the Eurasian continent at that time. No north-south component of shortening is evidenced north of Iran afterwards. An analysis of the declinations from the Late Permian to the present shows different, large rotations, emphasizing the important tectonic phases suffered since the Triassic. Finally, the authors propose palaeomagnetic reconstructions of the Tethys area during the Late Permian and the Late Triassic, showing that the Palaeotethys Ocean was narrower than previously thought, and did not widen its gate to the Panthalassa before the Triassic period.},

abstract = {Land-plant productivity was greatly reduced after the end-Permian mass extinction, causing a pronounced "coal gap" worldwide during the Early Triassic. Newly obtained organic geochemistry data from the Chaohu area, south China, indicated an abrupt and profound terrestrial vegetation change over the middle part of the Early Triassic Smithian-Spathian (S-S) interval. Herbaceous lycopsids and/or bryophytes dominated terrestrial vegetation from Griesbachian to Smithian times. The terrestrial ecosystem underwent an abrupt change, and woody conifers became dominant over the S-S interval. Several important biomarkers, namely retene, simonellite, and dehydroabietane (with multiple sources: conifer, lycopsid, and/or herbaceous bryophyte), were relatively abundant during Griesbachian, Dienerian, and Smithian times. The relatively low C/N ratio values during the Griesbachian-Smithian interval indicate that these biomarkers were likely sourced from herbaceous lycopsids and/or bryophytes. The extremely abundant conifer-sourced pimanthrene, combined with relatively high C/N ratio values, suggested the recovery of woody conifers after the S-S boundary. The new data revealed that the switch from herbaceous vegetation to woody coniferous vegetation marked a terrestrial plant recovery, which occurred globally within 3 million years after the end-Permian crisis rather than at a later date estimated in previous studies. In Chaohu, the S-S terrestrial event was marked by a reappearance of woody vegetation, while the S-S marine event was marked by an increase in ichnodiversity, trace complexity, burrow size, infaunal tiering level, and bioturbation level, and a possible intense upwelling event indicated by the extended tricyclic terpane ratios (ETR). Coeval vegetation changes with comparable patterns have also been documented in Europe and Pakistan based on palynologic studies. The S-S boundaries in Asia and Europe are associated with a positive $\delta$13C excursion, the rebound of woody vegetation, a turnover of ammonoid faunas, and possible global climate cooling. This is the first study to document the S-S event using biomarkers and C/N ratios. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction is associated with a global perturbation in the carbon isotopic composition of carbonates and organic matter, but such changes are not well documented from pelagic deep-sea sediments. One of the most continuous pelagic deep-sea Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB) sections, the Am-2 section, is exposed in the accretionary complexes of Japan. New data for organic carbon isotope ratios (??13Corg) were obtained from 36 samples from section Am-2. The ??13Corg excursion curve exhibits a negative shift of 2.0??? in the low-latitude, pelagic Panthalassic Ocean at the end of the Permian, which coincides with a radiolarian extinction. The ??13Corg values of pelagic, deep-sea Panthalassic sections and those of shallow-water sections from Panthalassic seamounts exhibit a smooth, negative shift that lacks temporary increases like those reported from Paleotethyan PTB sections. Absence of temporary ??13Corg increases at the PTB in Panthalassa may reflect less algal and bacterial blooming in pelagic Panthalassa compared to the shallow-water Paleotethys.},

abstract = {Ammonoids and conodonts, being characterized by exceptionally high background rates of origination and extinction, were vulnerable to global environmental crises, which characteristically intensified background rates of extinction. Thus, it is not surprising that these taxa suffered conspicuous mass extinctions at the times of three negative Early Triassic global carbon isotopic excursions that resembled those associated with the two preceding Permian mass extinctions. In keeping with their high rates of origination, both the ammonoids and conodonts rediversified dramatically between the Early Triassic crises. Other marine taxa, characterized by much lower intrinsic rates of origination, were held at low levels of diversity by the Early Triassic crises; because global mass extinctions affect all marine life, these taxa must have experienced relatively modest expansions and contractions that have yet to be discovered, because they do not stand out in the fossil record and because the stratigraphic ranges of these taxa, being of little value for temporal correlation, have not been thoroughly studied.},

abstract = {Facies, faunal and geochemical evidence from the Permian/Triassic boundary sediments of the Dolomites and Idaho indicates a major anoxic event in the earliest Triassic. In both regions, the basal beds consist of finely laminated micrites with common syngenetic pyrite. The only fauna consists of occasional bedding plane assemblages of Lingula or Claraia, a typical lower dysaerobic assemblage. This is a level where previous studies have shown a major negative carbon isotope excursion and a cerium anomaly. In the Dolomites, the pyritic micrite directly overlies strata containing a diverse and typically Permian marine fauna of algae, foraminifers (including fusulinids) and articulate brachiopods, implying an abrupt extinction in contradiction to many previous views. Sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Dolomite boundary sediments reveals a minor sequence boundary in the late Permian followed by extremely rapid transgression leading to the development of the relatively deep water pyritic micrite - a maximum flooding surface at the Permo-Triassic boundary. A further pulsed deepening in the lower Griesbachian, recorded in both the Dolomites and Idaho, lead to the widespread establishment of dysaerobic facies. It is clear that most of the extinctions occurred at the erathem boundary although the subsequent failure of the marine benthos to fill the empty ecospace in the ensuing Griesbachian may have been due to the widespread development of dysaerobic conditions.},

abstract = {Many biogeochemical anomalies coincide with the Late Permian Extinction (LPE; 252.28Ma). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the moretane/hopane anomaly that has been identified in samples from Meishan GSSP section in southeastern China. Here, we report homohopane, 2$\alpha$- and 3$\beta$-methylhomohopane and lithological data for a drill core from the Meishan section in southeastern China. Three intervals of elevated C 30 moretane/hopane ratios are recorded in the Lungtan, Yinkeng and Helongshan Formations. Moretane/hopane ratios of C 31-34 homohopanes and the 2$\alpha$- and 3$\beta$-methylhomohopanes display the same stratigraphic patterns as the C 30 moretane/hopane record. In light of the multiple and parallel moretane anomalies for the homohopane and 2$\alpha$- and 3$\beta$-methylhomohopane series, enhanced input from higher plant organic matter, such as coal and peat, does not adequately explain the observed isomer patterns. Correlation of high moretane/hopane ratios with low C 35 Homohopane Index (HHI) and high hopane/sterane values suggest increased input of hopanoids from oxic soils. Additionally, moretane/hopane ratios show excellent correlations with total clay percentages and specific clay types, particularly chlorite, illite, and mixed layer illite/smectite. We conclude that a combination of episodic hopanoid input from soil bacteria and diagenetic effects related to redox and detrital clays generated the unique moretane/hopane patterns at Meishan.Similar relationships of Ts/(Ts. +. Tm) with redox, source indicators, and lithology indicate that Ts/(Ts. +. Tm) is affected by the same factors controlling the moretane/hopane ratios. Berthierine, a clay that requires reducing conditions for formation, was detected in samples from the Lungtan Formation. We are unable to determine from our results whether the berthierine is authigenic or detrital, but future determination of the origin of berthierine at Meishan may offer additional environmental insight. No link between diasteranes and lithology was observed in this study suggesting that diasteranes are relatively unaffected by the detrital clay component of the Meishan sediments. In total, the results point toward the complex role of source input, lithology, and depositional redox conditions in the transformation of organic matter during maturation. Future work is required to elucidate the lithological effects on diagenetic processes, including biomarker genesis isomerization, and thermal degradation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope ratios of well-preserved brachiopod calcite and conodont apatite were used to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Middle and Late Devonian. By assuming an oxygen isotopic composition of –1permil V-SMOW for Devonian seawater, the oxygen isotope values of Eifelian and early Givetian brachiopods and conodonts give average palaeotemperatures ranging from 22 to 25 °C. Late Givetian and Frasnian palaeotemperatures calculated from delta18O values of conodont apatite are close to 25 °C in the early Frasnian and increase to 32 °C in the latest Frasnian and early Famennian. Oxygen isotope ratios of late Givetian and Frasnian brachiopods are significantly lower than equilibrium values calculated from conodont apatite delta18O values and give unrealistically warm temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 °C. Diagenetic recrystallization of shell calcite, different habitats of conodonts and brachiopods, as well as non-equilibrium fractionation processes during the precipitation of brachiopod calcite cannot explain the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite. Moreover, the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite with respect to equilibrium delta18O values calculated from conodont apatite is too large to be explained by a change in seawater pH that might have influenced the oxygen isotopic composition of brachiopod calcite. The realistic palaeotemperatures derived from delta18O apatite may suggest that biogenic apatite records the oxygen isotopic composition and palaeotemperature of Palaeozoic oceans more faithfully than brachiopod calcite, and do not support the hypothesis that the 18O /16O ratio of Devonian seawater was significantly different from that of the modern ocean.},

abstract = {In Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems nutrient-rich waters are transported to the ocean surface, fuelling high photoautotrophic primary production. Subsequent heterotrophic decomposition of the produced biomass increases the oxygen-depletion at intermediate water depths, which can result in the formation of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). OMZs can sporadically accumulate hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is toxic to most multicellular organisms and has been implicated in massive fish kills. During a cruise to the OMZ off Peru in January 2009 we found a sulfidic plume in continental shelf waters, covering an area {\textgreater}5500 km(2), which contained ∼2.2×10(4) tons of H2S. This was the first time that H2S was measured in the Peruvian OMZ and with ∼440 km(3) the largest plume ever reported for oceanic waters. We assessed the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the inhabiting microbial community by high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA, while its metabolic activity was determined with rate measurements of carbon fixation and nitrogen transformation processes. The waters were dominated by several distinct $\gamma$-, $\delta$- and $\epsilon$-proteobacterial taxa associated with either sulfur oxidation or sulfate reduction. Our results suggest that these chemolithoautotrophic bacteria utilized several oxidants (oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) to detoxify the sulfidic waters well below the oxic surface. The chemolithoautotrophic activity at our sampling site led to high rates of dark carbon fixation. Assuming that these chemolithoautotrophic rates were maintained throughout the sulfidic waters, they could be representing as much as ∼30{\%} of the photoautotrophic carbon fixation. Postulated changes such as eutrophication and global warming, which lead to an expansion and intensification of OMZs, might also increase the frequency of sulfidic waters. We suggest that the chemolithoautotrophically fixed carbon may be involved in a negative feedback loop that could fuel further sulfate reduction and potentially stabilize the sulfidic OMZ waters.},

abstract = {Precise stratigraphic analysis of Middle-Upper Permian and Lower Triassic sequence at Chaotian in northern Sichuan, China, identified two remarkable mass extinction horizons, one at the Middle-Upper Permian (Guadalupian-Lopingian; G-L) boundary and the other at the Upper Perrnian-Lower Triassic (P-T) boundary. Across each of the boundaries, biodiversity declined sharply in fusulinid, rugose coral, brachiopod, ammonite, conodont, and radiolaria. Both boundaries are characterized by two biohorizons, i.e., one marked by major extinction of preexisting fauna and the other by the first appearance of younger fauna. It is noteworthy that a peculiar rhyo-dacitic tuff bed occurs at each of the extinction horizons. Thus the Late Permian biosphere was strongly affected twice by highly explosive, severe volcanism. Regional correlation of the G-L and P-T boundary tuff beds throughout South China, and partly to Japan, positively suggests a cause-effect link between large-scale explosive volcanism and mass extinction.},

abstract = {A high-resolution geochemical record of a 120 cm black shale interval deposited during the Coniacian-Santonian Oceanic Anoxic Event 3 (ODP Leg 207, Site 1261, Demerara Rise) has been constructed to provide detailed insight into rapid changes in deep ocean and sediment paleo-redox conditions. High contents of organic matter, sulfur and redox-sensitive trace metals (Cd, Mo, V, Zn), as well as continuous lamination, point to deposition under consistently oxygen-free and largely sulfidic bottom water conditions. However, rapid and cyclic changes in deep ocean redox are documented by short-term (∼15-20 ka) intervals with decreased total organic carbon (TOC), S and redox-sensitive trace metal contents, and in particular pronounced phosphorus peaks (up to 2.5 wt{\%} P) associated with elevated Fe oxide contents. Sequential iron and phosphate extractions confirm that P is dominantly bound to iron oxides and incorporated into authigenic apatite. Preservation of this Fe-P coupling in an otherwise sulfidic depositional environment (as indicated by Fe speciation and high amounts of sulfurized organic matter) may be unexpected, and provides evidence for temporarily non-sulfidic bottom waters. However, there is no evidence for deposition under oxic conditions. Instead, sulfidic conditions were punctuated by periods of anoxic, non-sulfidic bottom waters. During these periods, phosphate was effectively scavenged during precipitation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides in the upper water column, and was subsequently deposited and largely preserved at the sea floor. After ∼15-25 ka, sulfidic bottom water conditions were re-established, leading to the initial precipitation of CdS, ZnS and pyrite. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of H2S in the water column led to extensive formation of sulfurized organic matter, which effectively scavenged particle-reactive Mo complexes (thiomolybdates). At Site 1261, sulfidic bottom waters lasted for ∼90-100 ka, followed by another period of anoxic, non-sulfidic conditions lasting for ∼15-20 ka. The observed cyclicity at the lower end of the redox scale may have been triggered by repeated incursions of more oxygenated surface- to mid-waters from the South Atlantic resulting in a lowering of the oxic-anoxic chemocline in the water column. Alternatively, sea water sulfate might have been stripped by long-lasting high rates of sulfate reduction, removing the ultimate source for HS- production. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Conversely, seawater had low Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios ({\textless}2.3) and relatively low Na+ concentrations during the Cambrian (540 to 520 Ma), Silurian (440 to 418 Ma), and Cretaceous (124 to 94 Ma), when calcite was the dominant nonskeletal carbonate and K-, Mg-, and Ca-bearing chloride salts, were the only potash evaporites.},

abstract = {The trace elements Re and Mo both behave conservatively in seawater yet are strongly enriched in reducing sediments. Their potential for authigenic enrichment above crustal concentrations is greater than for many other elements, due to the high ratio of [metal]sw/[metal]crust. We present sedimentary Re and Mo data from box- and multi-cores spanning a range of redox conditions, from well-oxygenated sites to locations with substantial sulfide concentrations. At the oxic sites, Re and Mo, as expected, accumulate at concentrations close to their crustal abundances. Re shows substantial enrichment in suboxic (absence of O2 and H2S) sediments of the Sea of Japan, in sediments within the oxygen minimum of the Pakistan margin, as well as in sediments underlying the sulfide-bearing waters of the Black Sea and Saanich Inlet. Re enrichment occurs in these cores just below the depths of Fe and U reduction. Only in the sediments underlying the sulfidic waters of the Black Sea and Saanich Inlet is there substantial authigenic Mo accumulation. Absence of Re and Mo enrichments in sediment trap samples from the sulfide-bearing basins suggests that the addition of both metals occurs at or below the sediment-water interface. The Re and Mo concentration profiles are modeled to hindcast the removal depth of Re and Mo in the sediments which, along with the Re/Mo ratio, determine whether oxic, suboxic or sulfidic conditions were present in the water column or in the sediments in the past. Using this approach, historical redox conditions can be inferred even in environments such as continental margins where a substantial lithogenic component can obscure authigenic enrichments of other metals.},

@article{Beauchamp2012,
abstract = {The Upper Carboniferous to Upper Permian deposits of the Sverdrup Basin (Arctic Canada) record a transition from carbonate to silica dominated shallow shelf ecosystems. Chert expansion started during the latest Carboniferous in distal deep-water slope environments when prolific warm-water, photozoan carbonate factories developed on the adjacent shallow shelves. A shift to heterozoan factories during the Sakmarian–Artinskian was caused by the introduction of cooler water in response to paleoceanographic changes along NW Pangea. By Kungurian time, heterozoan carbonate factories narrowed substantially while hyalosponge factories had expanded well into the mid shelves. A brief return to widespread heterozoan carbonate sedimentation occurred during the Wordian, followed by further encroachment of shallow shelves by biosiliceous factories during the Capitanian and Wuchiapingian. A major drop in relative rates of carbonate sediment accumulation with time suggests both carbonate and biosiliceous factories were under considerable stress prior to the Late Permian Extinction event. It is proposed that Sverdrup Basin waters became progressively more acidic in response to build up of atmospheric CO2 throughout the Permian which led to a gradual shoaling of the lysocline and the calcite compensation depth, which was amplified by upwelling along the northwestern margin of Pangea. Ocean acidification initiated in response to amalgamation of the Pangea supercontinent. This inhibited the silicate weathering-response through development of thick protective soil blankets. A temperature shock associated with the extinction event led to a major fall of the lysocline allowing carbonates to resume accumulation in spite of low pH conditions. The subsequent die off of terrestrial vegetation, stripping of soil cover, widespread continental erosion and repeated exposures of fresh rock surfaces associated with a major base level shift allowed silicate weathering to restart and drive oceans back to carbonate saturation.},

@article{Saltzman2001,
abstract = {The main episode of glaciation during the Late Paleozoic began just prior to the mid-Carboniferous boundary, based on evidence from Gondwanan tillites, and sequence stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic analysis in Euramerica. While gradual drawdown of atmospheric CO (sub 2) during the Devonian and Mississippian may have preconditioned the Earth for the most widespread glacial advance since the Neoproterozoic, an abrupt onset at approximately 320 Ma hints at a critical role for additional factors affecting the climate system, such as oceanic gateway closure. The relative importance of gateway closure versus CO (sub 2) drawdown in part relates to the interpretation of carbon isotope trends in Carboniferous carbonates. Carbon isotope values in European successions show a dramatic increase to a Phanerozoic maximum of approximately +6 per mil across the mid-Carboniferous boundary, which has been interpreted to reflect a period of globally enhanced organic carbon burial and CO (sub 2) drawdown associated with the widespread Pennsylvanian coal basins. However, new data from western North America do not show an equally large increase at this time and raises questions concerning the true magnitude of organic carbon burial and the origin of the European delta (super 13) C shift. Over 700 carbonate delta (super 13) C analyses from a 1.3 km marine succession at Arrow Canyon, Nevada, reveal a complex curve in which a large +7 per mil anomaly found in the lowermost Mississippian stage (Kinderhookian) stands far above the next highest peaks of +3-4 per mil in the Meramecian, Atokan and Missourian. This micrite-based curve is in good agreement with the brachiopod calcite curve of Mii et al. (1999) from the midcontinent of North America and indicates that the large, European mid-Carboniferous shift was not global. An alternative hypothesis for the large European delta (super 13) C shift is linked to the closing of the oceanic gateway between Euramerica and Gondwana associated with the assembly of Pangea, rather than high organic carbon burial. This gateway closure just prior to the mid-Carboniferous boundary increased the transport of heat and moisture to high southern latitudes of Gondwana, resulting in widespread glacial advance and eustatic drop. Gateway closure also had profound biological consequences, triggering widespread extinctions and leading to the development of a distinct Tethyan faunal realm.},

abstract = {Patterns of last occurrences of fossil species are often used to infer the tempo and timing of mass extinction, even though last occurrences generally precede the time of extinction. Numerical simulations with constant extinction demonstrate that last occurrences are not randomly distributed, but tend to cluster at subaerial unconformities, surfaces of forced regression, flooding surfaces and intervals of stratigraphical condensation, all of which occur in predictable stratigraphical positions. This clustering arises not only from hiatuses and non-deposition, but also from changes in water depth. Simulations with intervals of elevated extinction cause such clusters of last occurrences to be enhanced within and below the interval of extinction, suggesting that the timing and magnitude of extinctions in these instances could be misinterpreted. With the possible exception of the end-Cretaceous, mass extinctions in the fossil record are characterized by clusters of last occurrences at these sequence stratigraphical horizons. Although these clusters of last occurrences may represent brief pulses of elevated extinction, they are equally likely to form by stratigraphical processes during a protracted period (more than several hundred thousand years) of elevated extinction rate. Geochemical proxies of extinction causes are also affected similarly, suggesting that many local expressions of mass extinction should be re-evaluated for the timing of extinction and its relation to environmental change. We propose three tests for distinguishing pulses of extinction from clusters of last occurrences produced by stratigraphical processes.},

abstract = {Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are changing the carbonate chemistry of the oceans, a process known as ocean acidification (OA). Absorption of this CO2 by the surface oceans is increasing the amount of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and bicarbonate ion (HCO3 −) available for marine calcification yet is simultaneously lowering the seawater pH and carbonate ion concentration ([CO3 2−]), and thus the saturation state of seawater with respect to aragonite (Ωar). We investigated the relative importance of [HCO3 −] versus [CO3 2−] for early calcification by new recruits (primary polyps settled from zooxanthellate larvae) of two tropical coral species, Favia fragum and Porites astreoides. The polyps were reared over a range of Ωar values, which were manipulated by both acid-addition at constant pCO2 (decreased total [HCO3 −] and [CO3 2−]) and by pCO2 elevation at constant alkalinity (increased [HCO3 −], decreased [CO3 2−]). Calcification after 2 weeks was quantified by weighing the complete skeleton (corallite) accreted by each polyp over the course of the experiment. Both species exhibited the same negative response to decreasing [CO3 2−] whether Ωar was lowered by acid-addition or by pCO2 elevation—calcification did not follow total DIC or [HCO3 −]. Nevertheless, the calcification response to decreasing [CO3 2−] was nonlinear. A statistically significant decrease in calcification was only detected between Ωar = {\textless}2.5 and Ωar = 1.1–1.5, where calcification of new recruits was reduced by 22–37{\%} per 1.0 decrease in Ωar. Our results differ from many previous studies that report a linear coral calcification response to OA, and from those showing that calcification increases with increasing [HCO3 −]. Clearly, the coral calcification response to OA is variable and complex. A deeper understanding of the biomineralization mechanisms and environmental conditions underlying these variable responses is needed to support informed predictions about future OA impacts on corals and coral reefs.},

abstract = {Recently, a novel "electrogenic" type of sulfur oxidation has been documented in marine sediments, whereby long filamentous cable bacteria are generating electrical currents over centimeter-scale distances. Here we propose a numerical model description that is capable of quantitatively simulating the solute depth profiles and biogeochemical transformations in such electro-active marine sediments. The model is based on a conventional reactive transport description of marine sediments, which is extended with a new model formulation for the long-distance electron transport induced by the cable bacteria. The mechanism of electron hopping is implemented to describe the electron transport along the longitudinal axis of the microbial filaments. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing the observed geochemical fingerprint of electrogenic sulfur oxidation, which consists of a characteristic set of O2, pH and H2S depth profiles. Our simulation results suggest that the cable bacteria must have a high affinity for both oxygen and sulfide, and that intensive cryptic sulfur cycling takes place within the suboxic zone. A sensitivity analysis shows how electrogenic sulfur oxidation strongly impacts the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur, iron, carbon and calcium in marine sediments.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous period ({\~{}}145–65 m.y. ago) was characterized by intervals of enhanced organic carbon burial associated with increased primary production under greenhouse conditions. The global consequences of these perturbations, oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), lasted up to 1 m.y., but short-term nutrient and climatic controls on widespread anoxia are poorly understood. Here, we present a high-resolution reconstruction of oceanic redox and nutrient cycling as recorded in subtropical shelf sediments from Tarfaya, Morocco, spanning the initiation of OAE2. Iron-sulfur systematics and biomarker evidence demonstrate previously undescribed redox cyclicity on orbital time scales, from sulfidic to anoxic ferruginous (Fe-rich) water-column conditions. Bulk geochemical data and sulfur isotope modeling suggest that ferruginous conditions were not a consequence of nutrient or sulfate limitation, despite overall low sulfate concentrations in the proto–North Atlantic. Instead, fluctuations in the weathering influxes of sulfur and reactive iron, linked to a dynamic hydrological cycle, likely drove the redox cyclicity. Despite the potential for elevated phosphorus burial in association with Fe oxides under ferruginous conditions on the Tarfaya shelf, porewater sulfide generation drove extensive phosphorus recycling back to the water column, thus maintaining widespread open-ocean anoxia.},

abstract = {For the first time we report $\delta$D of kerogen ($\delta$Dkerogen) for three Permian–Triassic (P–Tr) sequences (Hovea{\#}3, Perth Basin, Western Australia; Jameson Land, East Greenland and Lusitaniadalen, Spitsbergen). We have compared $\delta$Dkerogen with $\delta$13C of kerogen ($\delta$13Ckerogen) and $\delta$34S of total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS, essentially pyrite; $\delta$34Spyrite) of all the sections and for one sample set with $\delta$13C of carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarbonate) to establish (i) similarities between the sections and (ii) evaluate whether these signals are local and/or global. Stable isotope shifts occur for all three sample sets either at the P–Tr transition (Western Australia) or coinciding with the marine ecosystem collapse (Spitsbergen and East Greenland). $\delta$Dkerogen reflects organic matter (OM)/ kerogen type and is not sensitive to the low level of thermal maturation. Reliable palaeoenvironmental information in terms of the use of $\delta$D can therefore only be obtained for the P–Tr transition from hydrogen compound-specific isotope analyses (CSIA) of biomarkers (Nabbefeld et al., 2010b). The negative shifts in $\delta$13Ccarbonate (primary) and $\delta$13Ckerogen are attributed to the release of 13C-depleted carbon into the atmosphere, whereas the isotopic excursions in $\delta$34Spyrite relate to palaeoredox changes. However, the global coincidence in timing of the shifts in $\delta$Dkerogen, $\delta$34Spyrite and $\delta$13Ckerogen suggests a relation between the sulfur, carbon and hydrogen cycles. The negative shifts in $\delta$13Ccarbonate (primary) are in general attributed to the release of 13C-depleted source of carbon into the oceans and atmosphere, whereas $\delta$13Ckerogen can reflect the latter in certain cases, but can also be superimposed by varying sources of OM/kerogen type. Isotopic excursions in $\delta$34Spyrite relate to global changes in the palaeoredox conditions that affect sulfur cycling in the ancient seas.},

abstract = {The latest Permian was a time of major change in ocean chemistry, accompanying the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic. To examine the nature of these changes, samples from two well-studied marine sections that span the Permian-Triassic boundary have been analyzed: the Meishan and Shangsi sections located in Southern China. Isotopic analysis of the carbonate-associated sulfate in these samples provides a detailed record of several isotopic shifts in delta34SCAS approaching and across the PTB, ranging from +30 to -15per mille sign (VCDT), with repeated asynchronous fluctuations at the two locations. We interpret the patterns of isotopic shifts, in conjunction with other data, to indicate a shallow unstable chemocline overlying euxinic deep-water which periodically upwelled into the photic zone. These chemocline upward excursion events introduced sulfide to the photic zone stimulating a bloom of phototrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria. We hypothesize that elemental sulfur globules produced by these organisms and 34S-depleted pyrite produced in the euxinic water column were deposited in the sediment; later oxidation led to incorporation as CAS. This created the large changes to the delta34SCAS observed in the latest Permian at these locations.},

abstract = {The sulfur biogeochemical cycle integrates the metabolic activity of multiple microbial pathways (e.g., sulfate reduction, disproportionation, and sulfide oxidation) along with abiotic reactions and geological processes that cycle sulfur through various reservoirs. The sulfur cycle impacts the global carbon cycle and climate primarily through the remineralization of organic carbon. Over geological timescales, cycling of sulfur is closely tied to the redox state of Earth's exosphere through the burial of oxidized (sulfate) and reduced (sulfide) sulfur species in marine sediments. Biological sulfur cycling is associated with isotopic fractionations that can be used to trace the fluxes through various metabolic pathways. The resulting isotopic data provide insights into sulfur cycling in both modern and ancient environments via isotopic signatures in sedimentary sulfate and sulfide phases. Here, we review the deep-time $\delta$34S record of marine sulfates and sulfides in light of recent advances in understanding how isotopic signatures are generated by microbial activity, how these signatures are encoded in marine sediments, and how they may be altered following deposition. The resulting picture shows a sulfur cycle intimately coupled to ambient carbon cycling, where sulfur isotopic records preserved in sedimentary rocks are critically dependent on sedimentological and geochemical conditions (e.g., iron availability) during deposition.},

@article{Arnaud2002,
abstract = {ABSTRACT There is much debate regarding the intensity and geographic extent of glaciation during the Neoproterozoic, particularly in response to recent geochemical work suggesting that the Neoproterozoic earth was at times ice covered from equator to poles (the 'Snowball Earth' hypothesis). A detailed sedimentological analysis of the Neoproterozoic Smalfjord Formation of northern Norway was conducted in order to determine the extent and intensity of glacial influence on sedimentation. In the Tarmfjorden area, the Smalfjord Formation consists of a stacked succession of diamictites interbedded with fine-grained laminated mudstones containing rare outsized clasts. Diamictites and interbedded mudstones are interpreted as the product of subaqueous mass flows generated along the basin margin. In the Varangerfjorden area, chaotically interbedded diamictites, conglomerates and sandstones are overlain by a thick succession of stacked sandstone beds; onediamictite unit at Bigganjargga overlies a striated pavement. The Varangerfjorden outcrops appear to record deposition on a subaqueous debris apron. Although diamictites contain rare striated and faceted clasts, suggesting a glacial sediment source, their origin as subaqueous mass flows prevents the interpretation of ice mass form or distribution. Rare lonestones may be associated with floating ice in the basin, which may be of glacial or seasonal origin. Glacial ice may have contributed poorly sorted glacial debris to the basin margin, either directly or through fluvioglacial systems, but there is no evidence of direct deposition by ice at Varangerfjorden or Tarmfjorden. The overall fining-upward trend identified in the Smalfjord Formation and overlying Nyborg Formation is consistent with depositional models of rift basin settings. This fining-upward trend, the predominance of mass flow facies including breccias associated with scarps and the evidence for extensional tectonic activity in the region suggest that tectonic activity may have played an important role in the development of this Neoproterozoic succession. The Smalfjord Formation at Tarmfjorden and Varangerfjorden does not exhibit sedimentological characteristics consistent with severe glacial conditions suggested by the snowball Earth hypothesis.},

abstract = {Learn How to Use Growth Curve Analysis with Your Time Course Data   An increasingly prominent statistical tool in the behavioral sciences, multilevel regression offers a statistical framework for analyzing longitudinal or time course data. It also provides a way to quantify and analyze individual differences, such as developmental and neuropsychological, in the context of a model of the overall group effects. To harness the practical aspects of this useful tool, behavioral science researchers need a concise, accessible resource that explains how to implement these analysis methods. Growth Curve Analysis and Visualization Using R provides a practical, easy-to-understand guide to carrying out multilevel regression/growth curve analysis (GCA) of time course or longitudinal data in the behavioral sciences, particularly cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology. With a minimum of statistical theory and technical jargon, the author focuses on the concrete issue of applying GCA to behavioral science data and individual differences.   The book begins with discussing problems encountered when analyzing time course data, how to visualize time course data using the ggplot2 package, and how to format data for GCA and plotting. It then presents a conceptual overview of GCA and the core analysis syntax using the lme4 package and demonstrates how to plot model fits. The book describes how to deal with change over time that is not linear, how to structure random effects, how GCA and regression use categorical predictors, and how to conduct multiple simultaneous comparisons among different levels of a factor. It also compares the advantages and disadvantages of approaches to implementing logistic and quasi-logistic GCA and discusses how to use GCA to analyze individual differences as both fixed and random effects. The final chapter presents the code for all of the key examples along with samples demonstrating how to report GCA results.  Throughout the book, R code illustrates how to implement the analyses and generate the graphs. Each chapter ends with exercises to test your understanding. The example datasets, code for solutions to the exercises, and supplemental code and examples are available on the author's website.},

abstract = {We review one of the most ancient of all the global biogeochemical cycles and one which reflects the profound geochemical and biological changes that have occurred as the Earth system has evolved through timethat of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In particular, we highlight a Mid-Mesozoic Revolution in the nature and location of carbonate deposition in the marine environment, driven by the ecological success of calcareous plankton. This drove the creation of a responsive deep-sea sedimentary sink of CaCO3. The result is that biologically driven carbonate deposition provides a significant buffering of ocean chemistry and of atmospheric CO2 in the modern system. However, the same calcifying organisms that under-pin the deep-sea carbonate sink are now threatened by the continued atmospheric release of fossil fuel CO2 and increasing acidity of the surface ocean. We are not yet in a position to predict what the impact on CaCO3 production will be, or how the uptake of fossil fuel CO2 by the ocean will be affected. This uncertainty in the future trajectory of atmospheric CO2 that comes from incomplete understanding of the marine carbonate cycle is cause for concern.},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotopic analyses of organic carbon ($\delta$13C) in individual paleosol profiles from Permian–Triassic sequences of Antarctica reveal systematic isotopic variations with profile depth. These variations are in many cases analogous to those in modern soils, which are functions of redox conditions, soil development, and degree and type of microbial decay. In modern soils, these isotopic depth functions develop independently from vegetation changes (C3 versus C4 vegetation) and can be diagnostic of soil orders. This study shows that soil-intrinsic functions can be preserved in the $\delta$13C values of paleosols as old as 260 Ma and constitute valuable data for paleoecological interpretations.A large carbon isotopic offset of as much as 10‰ in whole paleosol profiles across the Permian-Triassic boundary indicates significant changes in the soil biogeochemistry and the soil-atmosphere system. Early Triassic paleosols are distinctive in their extremely low $\delta$13C values (to −42‰) and often show an anomalous $\delta$13C depth distribution compared to both Permian paleosols and modern soils. Highly depleted $\delta$13C values, as the ones in Early Triassic paleosols, are suggested to be associated with microbial methane oxidation (methanotrophy). This hypothesis implies increased methane concentrations in the Early Triassic soil-atmosphere system. Increased atmospheric methane was probably partly responsible for the global carbon isotopic shift documented in marine and terrestrial sediments across the Permian–Triassic boundary.},

This includes fine lamination and abundant pyrite framboids commonly reworked into lags by storm events. The ''anoxic'' event spanned the entire Griesbachian Stage and extended from deep waters into extraordinarily shallow water settings; evidence for oxygen deficiency can be found in mid and inner ramp facies. The extent and duration of this event may at least partially explain the magnitude of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction. Normal benthic conditions returned rapidly in the Dienerian Stage and pervasively bioturbated distal ramp facies testify to the ventilation of the deeper water areas of the region in post-Griesbachian times. A post-mass extinction radiation is not particularly well displayed in either trace fossil or body fossil diversity compilations from the Dolomites. Moderate/low levels of trace fossil diversity are maintained throughout the post-Griesbachian Werfen Formation whilst the body fossil data shows a moderate increase from the mid-Smithian Stage. There is thus a curious lag period spanning the Dienerian to mid-Smithian when environmental conditions were apparently normal but the marine fauna failed to show any recovery.},

abstract = {The primary mineralogy of oolites and early marine carbonate cements led Sandberg [Nature 305 (1983), 19-22] to divide the Phanerozoic Eon into three intervals of 'aragonite seas' and two intervals of 'calcite seas'. Hardie [Geology 24 (1996), 279-283] has shown that these oscillations, together with synchronous oscillations in the mineralogy of marine potash evaporites, can be explained by secular shifts in the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater driven by changes in spreading rates along mid-ocean ridges. The Hardie model also predicts that high-Mg calcite should precipitate along with aragonite, as it does in today's aragonite sea. We have uncovered oscillations in the carbonate mineralogy of hypercalcifying organisms (ones that have produced massive skeletons, large reefs, or voluminous bodies of sediment) that correspond to Sandberg's aragonite seas and calcite seas and that are predicted by the Hardie model. Particular groups of corals, sponges, and algae appear to have been dominant reef builders only when favored by an appropriate Mg/Ca ratio in seawater. In early and middle Paleozoic calcite seas (Calcite I), reefs were dominated by calcitic tabulate, heliolitid, and rugose corals and calcitic stromatoporoids. In contrast, during the period of late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic aragonite seas (Aragonite II), aragonitic groups of sponges, scleractinian corals, and phylloid algae, as well as high-Mg calcitic red algae, were principal reef builders. During Late Cretaceous time, at the acme of Calcite II, massive rudists displaced aragonitic hermatypic corals. In today's aragonite sea (Aragonite III) scleractinian corals are again dominant reef builders, along with high-Mg calcitic coralline algae. Major sediment-producing algae exhibit temporal patterns similar to those of reef builders. Calcitic receptaculitids flourished during Calcite I, whereas aragonitic dasycladaceans did not become dominant rock formers until Aragonite II. During Calcite II, calcitic nannoplankton formed massive coccolith chalks in warm shallow seas of the Late Cretaceous, after the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater had reached a very low value and calcium concentration, a very high value. As the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater rose and calcium concentration fell during the Cenozoic Era, individual coccoliths, on average, became less massive and encrusted cells less thickly. By Pliocene time, during Aragonite III, the prominent genus Discoaster secreted only narrow-rayed coccoliths that covered less than 25{\%} of the cell surface. Also during Aragonite III, the aragonitic green alga Halimeda emerged as the dominant skeletal sediment producer in reef tracts. The influence of seawater chemistry on skeletal secretion appears to have been especially strong for morphologically simple taxa that exert relatively weak control over their own calcification. Such groups include algae, sponges, corals, and bryozoans. Morphological simplicity also permits these groups to adopt vegetative or colonial modes of growth that confer success in competition for space on reefs. This linkage, in addition to the basic chemical demands of hypercalcification, has given the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater strong control over the success of individual reef-building taxa. More generally, this ratio appears to have strongly influenced evolutionary changes in the skeletal mineralogy of sponges and cheilostome bryozoans throughout their history. We conclude that throughout Phanerozoic time a chain of causation has extended from mid-ocean ridge processes, via seawater chemistry, to the mineralogical and biological composition of reef communities and bioclastic carbonate deposits.},

abstract = {A distinct Pliocene eastern Mediterranean sapropel (i-282), recovered from three Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 160 Sites, has been investigated for its organic and inorganic composition. This sapropel is characterized by high organic carbon (C-org) and trace element contents, and the presence of isorenieratene derivatives. The latter suggests that the base of the photic zone was sulphidic during formation of the sapropel. Combined with evidence of bottom water anoxia (preservation of laminae, high redox-sensitive trace element contents, and the abundance and isotopic composition of pyrite) this leads to the tentative conclusion that almost the entire water column may have been anoxic. This anoxia resulted from high productivity and not from stagnation, because an approximation of the trace element budget during sapropel formation shows that water exchange with the western Mediterranean is needed. Entire water column anoxia has been suggested earlier for several black shales. With regard to the depositional environment and the C-org content, however, only the Cenomanian/Turonian Boundary Event (CTBE) black shales appear to be comparable to this sapropel. The proposed trace element removal mechanism of scavenging and (co-)precipitation in an anoxic water column, is thought to be similar for both types of deposits. The ultimate trace element source for the sapropel, however, is seawater, whereas it is hydrothermal and fluvial input for CTBE black shales (because they have a larger temporal and spatial distribution). Nonetheless, the C-org-rich eastern Mediterranean Pliocene sapropel discussed here may be considered to be a younger analogue of CTBE black shales. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {New records of the abundance of C-13 in marine organic matter have been compiled for (i) the later Neoproterozoic, from 800 to 543 Ma (346 analyses), (ii) the Cambrian through the Jurassic (1616 analyses), and (iii) the Cretaceous and Cenozoic (2493 analyses). Comparison of these to existing compilations of the abundance of C-13 in sedimentary carbonates has allowed development of a record of the isotopic fractionation (= epsilon(TOC)) accompanying the production and burial of organic material. Over time, globally averaged values of epsilon(TOC) have fallen in three ranges: (i) greater than 32 parts per thousand and apparently indicative of significant inputs from sulfide-oxidizing or other chemoautotrophic bacteria, notably during late Proterozoic interglacials at 752, 740-732, and 623-600 Ma; (ii) between 28 and 32 parts per thousand and indicative of maximal fractionation of carbon isotopes by phytoplanktonic producers, during the Neoproterozoic from 800 to 750 and from 685 to 625 Ma and during the Phanerozoic up to the early Oligocene; and (iii) less than 28 parts per thousand, probably reflecting a reduction of primary fractionation by some combination of low levels of CO2, rapid rates of growth, and high ratios of cellular volume to surface area during Neoproterozoic glaciations (740, 720, and 575 Ma) and since the early Oligocene. Evidence of similar variations during the Ordovician and Gondwanan glaciations is absent. The decline in epsilon(TOC) since the early Oligocene, from 30 to 22 parts per thousand, has been nearly linear. The structure of the record of epsilon(TOC) suggests that the maximal isotopic fractionation between dissolved CO2 and primary biomass has consistently been 25 parts per thousand. Overall, the records provide compelling evidence that values of epsilon(TOC) have varied widely and that the long-term average fractionation is roughly 30 parts per thousand.

abstract = {Cretaceous marine strata deposited in shallow to intermediate depths in the Western Interior seaway of North America show considerable variation in organic-carbon enrichment and degree of pyrite formation. The extreme range of paleoceanographic and depositional conditions that occurred in this seaway provide a unique opportunity to examine the effects of iron-, carbon-, and sulfur-limitation on pyrite formation in one region over about 30 my. Most of the Upper Cretaceous section consists of thick, rapidly deposited, black-shale units such as the Pierre Shale and its equivalents deposited during regressive stages of the seaway. Most of these black shales have organic-carbon contents of less than 2 percent and pyrolysis hydrogen indices that are less than 100, indicating that the organic matter is refractory. This organic matter probably was not suitable for extensive bacterial metabolism, so that pyrite formation in these shales was most likely limited by availability of reactive carbon. Two major transgressive stages of the seaway resulted in deposition of relatively thin, more slowly deposited pelagic carbonate units, the Bridge Creek Member of The Greenhorn Limestone and the Niobrara Formation. During these transgressive stages, periodic increased freshwater runoff led to increased water-column stability. These periods of increased stratification produced anoxic to slightly oxic bottom waters and enhanced preservation of primarily marine organic matter. Some of the more marly to shaly beds in each of these transgressive pelagic carbonate units have organic-carbon concentrations as hieh as 7 percent and pyrolysis hydrogen indices as high as 650 indicating that both units have significant hydrocarbon generating potential. All the iron in the Bridge Creek and Niobrara carbonate units apparently was reactive and has been converted to pyrite so that pyrite formation in these two units was severely iron limited. In addition, some black-shale units deposited during transgressive episodes (Mowry and Belle Fourche Shales and Sharon Springs Member of the Pierre Shale) contain abundant reactive organic matter, at least in some parts of the basin, and are iron-limited with regard to pyrite formation. Ternary diagrams of the system Fe-S-OC, together with some measure of the reactivity of organic matter (pyrolysis hydrogen index), provide a rapid means of recognizing iron-, carbon-, and sulfur-limitation on pyrite formation in a series of samples from a single lithologic unit. Iron limitation is indicated by a concentration of data along a line of constant S/Fe ratio on a Fe-S-OC ternary diagram. Carbon limitation is indicated by a concentration of data along a line of constant S/OC ratio. Sulfur-limitation is suggested by the lack of a systematic Fe-S-OC relationship and residual organic matter that is high in abundance and reactivity.},

abstract = {Organics are expected to exist on Mars based on meteorite infall, in situ production, and any possible biological sources. Yet they have not been detected on the martian surface; are they there, or are we not capable enough to detect them? The Viking gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer did not detect organics in the headspace of heated soil samples with a detection limit of parts per billion. This null result strongly influenced the interpretation of the reactivity seen in the Viking biology experiments and led to the conclusion that life was not present and, instead, that there was some chemical reactivity in the soil. The detection of perchlorates in the martian soil by instruments on the Phoenix lander and the reports of methane in the martian atmosphere suggest that it may be time to reconsider the question of organics. The high-temperature oxidizing properties of perchlorate will promote combustion of organics in pyrolytic experiments and may have affected the ability of both Phoenix's organic analysis experiment and the Viking mass spectrometer experiments to detect organics. So the question of organics on Mars remains open. A primary focus of the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory will be the detection and identification of organic molecules by means of thermal volatilization, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry--as was done on Viking. However, to enhance organic detectability, some of the samples will be processed with liquid derivatization agents that will dissolve organics from the soil before pyrolysis, which may separate them from the soil perchlorates. Nonetheless, the problem of organics on Mars is not solved, and for future missions other organic detection techniques should therefore be considered as well.},

abstract = {A marine Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) section at Nhi Tao, Vietnam, contains a series of at least 9 pyritic horizons characterized by concurrent decreases in pyrite S-(delta S-34(py)) and carbonate C-isotopic compositions (delta C-13(carb)). The first and largest of the events that precipitated these pyritic horizons was coincident with the Late Permian mass extinction, while subsequent events were generally smaller and occurred at quasiperiodic intervals of similar to 20 to 30 ka. A near complete lack of organic carbon to drive bacterial sulfate reduction in sediment pore waters, among other considerations, argues against a diagenetic control for these relationships. Rather, the covariant patterns documented herein are most easily explained as the product of recurrent upwelling of anoxic deep-ocean waters containing S-34- depleted hydrogen sulfide and C-13-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon. The sulfide delta S-34 record of the study section represents a mixture of a small amount of isotopically heavy authigenic pyrite (formed via in situ bacterial sulfate reduction) with a generally larger quantity of isotopically light syngenetic pyrite precipitated within the water column during upwelling episodes. Although upwelling of toxic deepwaters has been invoked in earlier studies as a mechanism for the Late Permian marine mass extinction, this is the first study to (1) document patterns of pyrite-delta C-13(carb) covariation that strongly support upwelling as a major process at the PTB and (2) provide evidence of multiple, quasiperiodic upwelling events that may reflect reinvigoration of global-ocean overturn following a prolonged interval of Late Permian deep-ocean stagnation.},

abstract = {The foraminiferal faunas and biostratigraphic correlation of the Tethyan uppermost Permian (Dzhulfian and Dorashamian) provide important paleogeographic and tectonic data for the interpretation of the Palaeofusulina-bearing terranes in East and Southeast Asia. These interpretations have a significant bearing on understanding Japanese pre-Cretaceous tectonostratigraphic and micropaleontologic data, as well as the geodynamic evolution of the Japanese Palaeofusulina-bearing terranes. The Tethyan foraminiferal fauna in the uppermost Permian is characterized by the occurrence of provincial and endemic schubertellid genera, and the absence of neoschwagerinids and verbeekinids which had characterized the rapidly evolving Middle Permian Tethyan marine faunas until their extinction at the end of the Midian. Difficulties in world-wide correlation of the uppermost Permian have resulted because of different geographic faunal compositions and the geographic patterns of extinction of Permian marine faunas. The Palaeofusulina fauna is one of the most reliable indicators of the uppermost Permian. Its presence or absence serves as paleogeographic constraints on East and Southeast Asian terranes. For example, the absence of Palaeofusulina fauna and the presence of late Midian Lepidolina multiseptata faunas in the Lhasa Terrane in Tibet and the Wolya Terrane in Sumatra (the third continental sliver north of Gondwana) are important, particularly, for identifying the rift–drift–collision process of the Gondwana-affinity terranes. They suggest a Late Permian separation of the two terranes from Gondwana. Tethyan Palaeofusulina occur in the latest Permian tropical to subtropical latitudinal belt and along with other geologic data assist in paleogeographic reconstructions and in interpreting the possible movement and emplacement of the Palaeofusulina-bearing terranes such as the Maizuru, South Kitakami–Kurosegawa and Chichibu terranes in Japan. They reveal that: (1) the Upper Permian Maizuru Group was deposited on the eastern continental margin of South China; (2) the occurrence of the Lower Permian Cathaysian flora and a number of geologic data in the South Kitakami–Kurosegawa suggest an arc–trench system setting and the Late Permian deposition in a shallow open-marine environment in proximity to South China; (3) foraminiferal biogeograpic data and the reconstructed oceanic plate stratigraphy in the Chichibu Terrane constrain the location of the Chichibu Seamount Chains to the western part of the Panthalassan domain, as they moved westwards against the Cathaysian Continent until their Jurassic accretion.},

A 4- to 5-million-year period of lycopsid dominance followed, and renewed proliferation of conifers did not occur before the transition between Early and Middle Triassic. We document this delayed re-establishment of equatorial forests on the basis of palynological data. The reconstructed pattern of vegetational change suggests that habitat restoration, migration, and evolutionary processes acted synergistically, setting the stage for successional replacement of lycopsid dominants by conifers within a period of approximately 0.5 million years.},

The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems.

@article{Kozur2007,
abstract = {The conodont succession and stratigraphic events around the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) have been investigated in detail in the open sea deposits of Iran (Abadeh and Shahreza in central Iran, and Jolfa and Zal in northwestern Iran). This investigation produced a very detailed conodont zonation from the Clarkina nodosa Zone up to the Isarcicella isarcica Zone. All significant events have been accurately located and dated within this zonation, and the duration of most of these conodont zones has been calculated by cross-correlation with continental lake deposits that display obvious Milankovitch cyclicity. The unusually short duration of all conodont zones in the interval from the C. nodosa up to the Hindeodus parvus Zone indicates that there was persistent high ecological stress during this time interval. Most of the conodont zones can be accurately correlated with South China. In the interval from the C. hauschkei Zone to the H. parvus Zone, even correlation with the Arctic is possible. Within three thin stratigraphic intervals, the Changhsingian (Dorashamian) warm water conodont fauna of the C. subcarinata lineage is replaced by a cool water fauna with small H. typicalis, rare Merrillina sp., and cool water Clarkina that have very widely spaced denticles. The uppermost cool water fauna horizon comprises the lower C. zhangi Zone and can be accurately correlated with continental beds by recognition of a short reversed magnetozone below the long uppermost Permian–lowermost Triassic normal magnetozone. In Iran and Transcaucasia, this short reversed zone comprises the upper C. changxingensis–C. deflecta Zone and most of the C. zhangi Zone. Its top lies 50 cm below the top of the Paratirolites Limestone (s.s.) in the Dorasham 2 section, which is at the beginning of the upper quarter of the C. zhangi Zone. In the Germanic Basin, this short palaeomagnetic interval comprises the lower and the basal part of the upper Fulda Formation. On the Russian Platform, the Nedubrovo Formation belongs to this short reversed magnetic interval. In its upper part (corresponding to the top of the lower C. zhangi Zone, see above) there is a fallout of mafic tuffs from the Siberian Trap event that originated about 3000 km away in eruption centres in the Siberian Tungusska Basin. In the Germanic Basin and in Iran, this horizon contains volcanic microsphaerules. Thus, a direct correlation can be made between the immigration of a cool water fauna into the tropical realm and an exceptionally strong interval of explosive activity during the Siberian Trap volcanic episode. These faunal changes are the same as those found at the base of the Boundary Clay, suggesting that a short cooling event at this horizon also was due to intense volcanism. Additional influence by a bolide impact cannot be excluded. Most of the events in the interval from the C. nodosa up to the I. isarcica Zone (upper Changhsingian to middle Gangetian) in the Iranian sections can be also observed in other marine sections (e.g., in Meishan) and even in continental sections of the Germanic Basin. Of particular significance is the fact that, in the investigated Iranian sections, the PTB lies either in red sediments or in light grey sediments (as in Abadeh) that contain an ostracod fauna indicative of highly oxygenated bottom waters. Therefore, anoxia cannot be the reason for the PTB extinction event in this region, even though anoxia does cause locally or regionally elsewhere an overprint on the extinction event.},

abstract = {One hundred fifty-six biogenic calcites and 96 whole rock carbonate samples of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age have been analysed for their sulfur isotopic composition. Recorded in structurally substituted sulfate (SSS) in the calcite lattice, the sulfur isotopic composition is thought to reflect the sulfur isotope value of ambient seawater sulfate. Possible alterations of the signal have been assessed, confirming the validity of this approach and the reliability of the resulting temporal record. The new sulfur isotope data substantially enhances our knowledge about secular variations of the global sulfur cycle during the Phanerozoic. Specifically for the Paleozoic, 177 new measurements of SSS in stratigraphically well-constrained samples provide a coherent and detailed dataset. This is extended through the entire Mesozoic via 75 measurements of delta34SSSS, largely for biogenic calcites. Long-term changes and short-term oscillations in the sulfur isotopic composition of seawater sulfate have been observed, which are thought to reflect changes in the fractional burial of sulfide sulfur. Our new sulfur isotope data measured for structurally substituted sulfate in carbonates, and additional data from Cenozoic foraminifera and marine barites, provide a new temporal record for the sulfur isotopic composition of Phanerozoic seawater sulfate. This new record is superior in its continuity and time resolution to currently available datasets and should replace them in future considerations of Earth System Evolution.},

@article{Boller2015,
abstract = {The cosmopolitan, bloom-forming diatom, Skeletonema costatum, is a prominent primary producer in coastal oceans, fixing CO2 with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) that is phylogenetically distinct from terrestrial plant RubisCO. RubisCOs are subdivided into groups based on sequence similarity of their large subunits (IA-ID, II, and III). ID is present in several major oceanic primary producers, including diatoms such as S. costatum, coccolithophores, and some dinoflagellates, and differs substantially in amino acid sequence from the well-studied IB enzymes present in most cyanobacteria and in green algae and plants. Despite this sequence divergence, and differences in isotopic discrimination apparent in other RubisCO enzymes, stable carbon isotope compositions of diatoms and other marine phytoplankton are generally interpreted assuming enzymatic isotopic discrimination similar to spinach RubisCO (IB). To interpret phytoplankton $\delta$(13) C values, S. costatum RubisCO was characterized via sequence analysis, and measurement of its KCO2 and Vmax , and degree of isotopic discrimination. The sequence of this enzyme placed it among other diatom ID RubisCOs. Michaelis-Menten parameters were similar to other ID enzymes (KCO2 = 48.9 ± 2.8 $\mu$m; Vmax = 165.1 ± 6.3 nmol min(-1 ) mg(-1) ). However, isotopic discrimination ($\epsilon$ = [(12) k/(13) k - 1] × 1000) was low (18.5‰; 17.0-19.9, 95{\%} CI) when compared to IA and IB RubisCOs (22-29‰), though not as low as ID from coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi (11.1‰). Variability in $\epsilon$-values among RubisCOs from primary producers is likely reflected in $\delta$(13) C values of oceanic biomass. Currently, $\delta$(13) C variability is ascribed to physical or chemical factors (e.g. illumination, nutrient availability) and physiological responses to these factors (e.g. carbon-concentrating mechanisms). Estimating the importance of these factors from $\delta$(13) C measurements requires an accurate $\epsilon$-value, and a mass-balance model using the $\epsilon$-value for S. costatum RubisCO is presented. Clearly, appropriate $\epsilon$-values must be included in interpreting $\delta$(13) C values of environmental samples.},

Under the microscope, the end-Permian mass extinction horizon is calibrated to a 12-mm stratal interval, the top being 19 mm below the top of Bed 24e of the Changhsing Formation. This abrupt disappearance of skeletal fragments of major benthos characterizes the end-Permian extinction event, suggesting a catastrophic event. An abrupt decrease in the 34S/32S ratios of seawater sulfate is confirmed to coincide with the end-Permian event horizon. The sulfur isotope event is thought to have been caused by an overturn of a stratified ocean dominated by H2S, implying coincidence of the oceanic mixing and the mass extinction. Coincident Siberian flood volcanism may have triggered a long-term ({\textgreater} 103 years) cooling leading an ocean mixing. A presumed comet impact to the ocean could have directly caused ocean mixing and the mass extinction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {While demonstrating ocean acidification in the modern is relatively$\backslash$nstraightforward (measure increase in atmospheric CO2 and corresponding$\backslash$nocean chemistry change), identifying palaeo-ocean acidification is$\backslash$nproblematic. The crux of this problem is that the rock record is$\backslash$na constructive archive while ocean acidification is essentially a$\backslash$ndestructive (and/or inhibitory) phenomenon. This is exacerbated in$\backslash$ndeep time without the benefit of a deep ocean record. Here, we discuss$\backslash$nthe feasibility of, and potential criteria for, identifying an acidification$\backslash$nevent in deep time. Furthermore, we investigate the evidence for$\backslash$nocean acidification during the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary interval,$\backslash$nan excellent test case because 1) it occurs in deep time, beyond$\backslash$nthe reach of deep sea drilling coverage; 2) a potential trigger for$\backslash$nacidification is known; and 3) it is associated with one of the `Big$\backslash$nFive' mass extinctions which disproportionately affected modern-style$\backslash$ninvertebrates. Three main criteria suggest that acidification may$\backslash$nhave occurred across the T-J transition. 1) The eruption of the Central$\backslash$nAtlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the associated massive and$\backslash$nrapid release of CO2 coincident with the end-Triassic mass extinction$\backslash$nprovide a suitable trigger for an acidification event (full carbonate$\backslash$nundersaturation in the surface ocean is possible but improbable).$\backslash$n2) Tentative evidence for a global paucity of carbonate across the$\backslash$nend-Triassic mass extinction versus the adjacent stratigraphy is$\backslash$nconsistent with a predicted sedimentary response to acidification.$\backslash$n3) The end-Triassic mass extinction was particularly selective against$\backslash$nacid-sensitive organisms (more so than perhaps any other extinction$\backslash$nevent) and temporarily eliminated coral reefs. Therefore multiple$\backslash$nlines of evidence are consistent with a T-J ocean acidification event$\backslash$nwithin our current resolution to recognise such events in deep time.$\backslash$nThe conclusion that the end-Triassic extinction was influenced by$\backslash$nacidification implies that short-term acidification perturbations$\backslash$nmay have long-term effects on ecosystems, a repercussion that has$\backslash$npreviously not been established. Although anthropogenic emissions$\backslash$nare more rapid than any event in the geologic record, events such$\backslash$nas the T-J can serve as partial analogues for the present anthropogenic$\backslash$ncarbon release. Since the T-J was such a pronounced crisis for both$\backslash$nmodern-style marine invertebrates and scleractinian reefs, it is$\backslash$nof particular interest in terms of informing projections about the$\backslash$neffects of modern ocean acidification.

They have become especially important for the reconstruction of early life on Earth and, potentially, for the detection of life in the extraterrestrial realm. However, it is not always clear how exactly biomarkers reflect a paleoecosystem as their preservation may be influenced by increasing temperatures (T) and pressures (P) during burial. While a number of biomarker indices reflecting thermal maturity have been established, it is often less well constrained to which extent biomarker ratios used for paleoreconstruction are compromised by T and P processes. In this study we conducted hydrous pyrolysis of Green River Shale (GRS) kerogen in gold capsules for 2–2400 h at 300°C to assess the maturation behaviour of several compounds used as life tracers and for the reconstruction of paleoenvironments ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -alkanes, pristane, phytane, gammacerane, steranes, hopanes and cheilanthanes). Lignite samples were maturated in parallel with the GRS kerogen to obtain exact vitrinite reflectance data at every sampling point. Our experiment confirms the applicability of biomarker-based indices and ratios as maturity indicators (e.g. total cheilanthanes/hopanes ratio; sterane and hopane isomerization indices). However, several biomarker ratios that are commonly used for paleoreconstructions (e.g. pristane/phytane, pristane/ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -C {\textless}sub{\textgreater}17{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} , phytane/ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -C {\textless}sub{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and total steranes/hopanes) were considerably affected by differences in the thermal degradation behaviour of the respective compounds. Short-term experiments (48 h) performed at 400°C also revealed that biomarkers {\&}gt;C {\textless}sub{\textgreater}15{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (especially steranes and hopanes) and ‘biological' chain length preferences for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -alkanes are vanished at a vitrinite reflectance between 1.38 and 1.83{\%} {\textless}italic{\textgreater}R{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}O{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} . Our data highlight that ‘thermal taphonomy' effects have to be carefully considered in the interpretation of biomarkers in ancient rocks and, potentially, extraterrestrial materials. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Carbonate-associated sulphate (CAS) extracted from a Permo–Triassic succession at Siusi in northern Italy is shown to preserve a true seawater-sulphate isotope record. Two periods of increasing $\delta$34S and $\delta$18O in CAS provide evidence for increased oceanic anoxia in the Late Permian and the Early Triassic. These two anoxic episodes are separated by an event characterised by the addition of isotopically light sulphur and oxygen to the oceanic sulphate pool. Simple mass balance calculations suggest that this sulphate originates from the reoxidation of bacterially derived H2S during oceanic mixing, rather than a volcanogenic source. A dramatic fall in CAS-$\delta$18O directly above the P–T boundary, not accompanied by a large change in CAS-$\delta$34S, records an oceanic deoxygenation event probably caused by the release of methane from gas hydrates, subsequently recorded in the carbonate-carbon isotope record. The decline of Early Triassic oceanic anoxia is not recorded by a fall in CAS-$\delta$34S, but is preserved by declining CAS-$\delta$18O. This is because of an increase in the flux of reactive iron to the oceans during the Early Triassic anoxic episode, triggered by the demise of land plants. This permanently removes a greater proportion of light sulphur from the oceanic sulphate reservoir as pyrite, and means that the heavy residual sulphate-sulphur isotope signature of Griesbachian anoxic seawater is preserved as a geochemical ‘fossil' until the beginning of the Middle Triassic.},

@article{Michalopoulos2004,
abstract = {Deltaic environments are commonly assumed to be relatively minor sites of biogenic silica burial because of the small quantities of opaline silica detected by most operational analytical techniques. Rapid conversion of biogenic silica into authigenic silicates is also often discounted as a significant control on oceanic silica budgets. A variety of evidence for extensive early diagenetic alteration of biogenic silica in rapidly accumulating Amazon delta sediments indicates that both of these general assumptions are unjustified. Apparent lack of significant biogenic silica storage in deltaic environments, particularly in the tropics, may be largely an artifact of operational definitions that do not include early diagenetic products of biogenic silica. Biogenic silica particles buried in suboxic Amazon delta deposits can be unaltered, partially dissolved, covered with aluminosilicate or metal-rich coatings, or completely reconstituted into authigenic K-Fe-rich aluminosilicate minerals. Pore water (K, Mg, F, Si) and solid-phase distributions, direct observations of particles, laboratory experiments, and depositional context indicate that authigenic clays form rapidly ({\textless}1 yr) in the seasonally reworked surface layer (??? 0.5-2 m) of the delta topset and are disseminated during sediment remobilization. Fe, Al-oxide rich debris derived from the tropical drainage basin is an abundant reactant, and thus the supply of biogenic silica is a major control on the amount of clay formed. The mild 1{\%} Na2CO3 alkaline leach procedure commonly used to estimate biogenic silica was modified to include an initial mild leach step with 0.1N HCl to remove metal oxide coatings and to activate poorly crystalline authigenic phases for alkaline dissolution. Well-crystallized clays are not significantly affected by this modification nor is bulk Amazon River bed sediment. The two-step procedure indicates that ???90{\%} of the biogenic silica originally present in deposits is converted to clay or otherwise altered, raising the effective quantity of biogenic silica stored from ???33 to ???296 ??mol Si g-1 (???1.8{\%} SiO2). Biogenic Si stored in the delta increases away from the river mouth, across shelf and along the dispersal system where primary production is highest. The K/Si ratio of labile authigenic material is ???0.19 mol mol-1, far higher than Amazon River suspended matter (???0.07 mol mol-1). Diagenetic models indicate formation rates in the mobile sediment layer of ???2.8 ??mol K g-1 yr-1 (???16 ??mol Si g-1 yr-1). Inclusion of authigenic alteration products of biogenic silica in estimates of reactive Si burial increases the deltaic storage of riverine Si to ???22{\%} of the Amazon River input. The rapid formation of aluminosilicates from biogenic SiO2, seawater solutes, and remobilized Fe, Al-oxides represents a form of reverse weathering. Rapid reverse weathering reactions in tropical muds and deltaic deposits, the largest sediment depocenters on Earth, confirms the general importance of these processes in oceanic elemental cycles. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

The effects of the presence of a concentration boundary layer (CBL), light limitations, and activity corrections are included in the analysis. Results of the model establish that the phosphate buffer, the presence of a CBL, and light limitations have a significant impact on the predicted flux of inorganic carbon into algal biofilms, whereas the effects of background ions, activity corrections, and algal surface charges can be neglected.},

@article{Heydari2008,
abstract = {The Earth experienced a severe mass extinction at the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) about 252 million years ago. This biological catastrophe was accompanied by major changes in geochemical composition of the atmosphere and ocean and the appearance of sedimentary features which had not occurred since the Precambrian time. The eruption of the largest continental flood basalt, the Siberian Traps, overlapped this mass killing. Many hypotheses have been proposed but no definitive conclusion currently exits. Here we present characteristics of three sections from Iran and China and propose that an active mantle plume initiated a series of processes which led to the mass mortality and produced major sedimentological, mineralogical, and geochemical changes observed in the transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic. The injection of mantle plume-related igneous dike swarms into the continental margin facilitated the release of massive amounts of CH4 primarily from the dissociation of marine gas hydrates and secondarily from the maturation of organic-rich sediments and fracturing of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The bulk of the CH4 was aerobically oxidized in the water column producing dissolved CO2 with low delta C-13 values. This CO2-saturated seawater became acidic to the point of dissolution of shelf carbonates promoting precipitation of siliciclasticrich strata in the transition from the Permian to the Triassic. Methane-derived CO2 also lowered carbon isotopic composition of seawater leading to the observed decline in delta C-13 composition of organic and inorganic marine carbon at the PTB. Gas-charged oceans released large volumes of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere which created a severe global warming (the end-Permian inferno) causing the release of additional CH4 from the dissociation of polar gas hydrates. These events lowered delta C-13 Compositions of terrestrial carbon. Simultaneously, feeder dikes from the mantle plume formed the Siberian Traps flood basalt. Marine mass extinction was the result of a change in seawater composition due to the injection and oxidation of CH4 in the water column causing low pH, high concentrations Of CO2, Ca2+ and HCO3-, and low CO32- U S. Combined with a hot seawater temperature, these changes made calcification of marine organisms difficult and produced major physiological crisis including reduced metabolic rates, high sensitivity to environmental stress, and hampered growth and reproduction. Terrestrial mass extinction can be attributed to severe global warming and soil acidification produced by increased atmospheric CO2, acid rain that was generated by SO2 derived from the Siberian trap eruption, and loss of habitat. Cessation of the plume activity during Early Triassic stopped the release of CH4 into the ocean and terminated continental flood basalt eruption ending the environment of death on land and in sea. The Cut off of CO2 production in the ocean instantly increased carbonate saturation of seawater resulting in extensive seafloor cementation. It also resulted in the deposition of marine carbonates by microbial activities in the hostile postextinction environment. From the trigger to recovery, the perturbation which included the end-Permian mass mortality could have lasted for at least 2 Myr. Several major mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic are temporally accompanied by flood basalt eruptions. So far, these two events have been interpreted in a cause-and-effect relation: flood basalt eruption causes mass extinction. This study proposes that flood basalts and their time correlative biological crises are themselves the consequence of a complex perturbation caused by mantle plume activities. If so, major disturbances in the near surface of the Earth are ultimately controlled by changes in the mantle. The physical sedimentological observations presented here combined with previous paleontological evidence cast doubt on other interpretations which use geochemical variables, numerical modeling, biomarkers, and Ce anomaly to suggest that Late Permian ocean was anoxic all the way to the photic zone.

The SOIR instrument combines an echelle spectrometer and an Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF) for order selection. It performs solar occultation measurements in the Venus atmosphere in the IR region (2.2-4.3$\mu$m), at a resolution of 0.12-0.18cm-1. The wavelength range probed by SOIR allows a detailed chemical inventory of the Venus atmosphere above the cloud layer (65-150km) to be made with emphasis on the vertical distributions of gases. Thanks to the SOIR spectral resolution, a new CO2 absorption band was identified: the 21101-01101 band of 16O12C18O with R branch up to J=31. Two other previously reported bands were observed dispelling any doubts about their identifications: the 20001-00001 band of 16O13C18O [Villanueva G, et al.

abstract = {The two major characteristics of the framboidal texture, the external spheroidal form and the internal microcrys{\~{}}!!ine microarchitecture, are described in detail. It is shown that the spheroidal form can o,:cur independently of the microcryst organisation and that aggregates of organised microcrysts are also observed in irregular non-spheroidal textures. Genetically, therefore, these two characteristic framboidal features are consideced separately. The development of the internal structure of the framboids is explained entirely as a function of the formation processes of pyrite, and the surface and crystal chemistry of the microcrysts. However, the spheroidal form is an inherited characteristic. It is shown that the physico-chemical, mechanical and spatial requirements of this texture are satisfied by processes involving the replacement or infilling of organic globules and gaseous vacuoles.},

abstract = {A new mass balance model for the coupled marine cycles of phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) is used to examine the relationships between oceanic circulation, primary productivity, and sedimentary burial of reactive P and particulate organic C (POC), on geological time scales. The model explicitly represents the exchanges of water and particulate matter between the continental shelves and the open ocean, and it accounts for the redox-dependent burial of POC and the various forms of reactive P (iron(III)-bound P, particulate organic P (POP), authigenic calcium phosphate, and fish debris). Steady state and transient simulations indicate that a slowing down of global ocean circulation decreases primary production in the open ocean, but increases that in the coastal ocean. The latter is due to increased transfer of soluble P from deep ocean water to the shelves, where it fuels primary production and causes increased reactive P burial. While authigenic calcium phosphate accounts for most reactive P burial ocean-wide, enhanced preservation of fish debris may become an important reactive P sink in deep-sea sediments during periods of ocean anoxia. Slower ocean circulation globally increases POC burial, because of enhanced POC preservation under anoxia in deep-sea depositional environments and higher primary productivity along the continental margins. In accordance with geological evidence, the model predicts increased accumulation of reactive P on the continental shelves during and following periods of ocean anoxia.},

@article{Smith1990,
abstract = {The Karoo Supergroup covers almost two thirds of the present land surface of southern Africa. Its strata record an almost continuous sequence of continental sedimentation that began in the Permo-Carboniferous (280 Ma) and terminated in the early Jurassic 100 million years later. The glacio-marine to terrestrial sequence accumulated in a variety of tectonically controlled depositories under progressively more arid climatic conditions. Numerous vertebrate fossils are preserved in these rocks, including fish, amphibians, primitive aquatic reptiles, primitive land reptiles, more advanced mammal-like reptiles, dinosaurs and even the earliest mammals. Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the major stratigraphic units of the Karoo sequence demonstrates the effects of more localised tectonic basins in influencing depositional style. These are superimposed on a basinwide trend of progressive aridification attributed to the gradual northward migration of southwestern Gondwanaland out of polar climes and accentuated by the meteoric drying effect of the surrounding land masses. Combined with progressive climatic drying was a gradual shrinking of the basin brought about by the northward migration of the subducting palaeo-Pacific margin to the south. Following deposition of the Cape Supergroup in the pre-Karoo basin there was a period of uplift and erosion. At the same time the southern part of Gondwana migrated over the South Pole resulting in a major ice-sheet over the early Karoo basin and surrounding highlands. Glacial sedimentation in both upland valley and shelf depositories resulted in the basal Karoo Dwyka Formation. After glaciation, an extensive shallow sea remained over the gently subsiding shelf fed by large volumes of meltwater. Black clays and muds accumulated under relatively cool climatic conditions (Lower Ecca) with perhaps a warmer “interglacial” during which the distinctive Mesosaurus-bearing, carbonaceous shales of the Whitehill Formation were deposited. Deformation of the southern rim of the basin, caused by the subducting palaeo-Pacific plate, resulted in mountain ranges far to the south. Material derived from this source, as well as granitic uplands to the west and morth-east, was deposited on large deltas that built out into the Ecca sea (Upper Ecca). The relatively cool climate and lowland setting promoted thick accumulations of peat on the coastal and delta plains and which now constitute the major coal reserves of southern Africa. Later the prograding deltas coalesced to fill most of the basin after which fluvial sedimentation of the Beaufort Group dominated. The climate by this time (Late Permian) had warmed to become semi-arid with highly seasonal rainfall. The central parts of the basin were for the most part drained by fine-grained meanderbelts and semi-permanent lakes. Significant stratabound uranium reserves have been delimited in the channel sandstones of the Beaufort Group in the southwestern parts of the basin. Pulses of uplift in the southern source areas combined with a possible orogenic effect resulted in two coarser-grained alluvial fans prograding into the more central parts of the basin (Katberg Sandstone Member and Molteno Formation). In the upper Karoo sequence progressive aridification dominated depositional style with playa lake and wadi-type environments (Elliot Formation) that finally gave way to a dune sand dominated system (Clarens Formation). Basinwide volcanic activity of the early Jurassic Drakensberg Group brought deposition in the Karoo Basin to a close. Le supergroupe du Karoo couvre presque les deux tiers de la surface continentale actuelle de l'Afrique du Sud et ses strates repr{\'{e}}sentent une s{\'{e}}quence presque continue de s{\'{e}}dimentation continentale depuis le Permo-Carbonif{\`{e}}re (280 Ma) jusqu'au d{\'{e}}but du Jurassique, 100 millions d'ann{\'{e}}es plus tard. Les s{\'{e}}quences glacio-marines {\`{a}} terrestress se sont accumul{\'{e}}es dans des bassins de style tectonique vari{\'{e}} et sous des conditions climatiques progressivement plus arides. De nombreux fossiles de v{\'{e}}rt{\'{e}}bres ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} pr{\'{e}}serv{\'{e}}s dans ces roches: poissons, amphibiens, reptiles aquatiques primitifs, reptiles terrestress primitifs, reptiles plus {\'{e}}volu{\'{e}}s proches des mammif{\`{e}}res, dinosaures et m{\^{e}}me les tout premiers mammif{\`{e}}res. L'analyse pal{\'{e}}o-environmentale des grandes unit{\'{e}}s stratigraphiques de la s{\'{e}}quence du Karoo fait ressortir la fa{\c{c}}on dont les bassins tectoniques plus localis{\'{e}}s ont pu influencer un style de d{\'{e}}p{\^{o}}t. Ceux-ci sont surimpos{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} une tendance g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rale du bassin vers l'aridification attribu{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} la migration progressive vers le nord du sud-ouest du continent de Gondwana qui s'{\'{e}}loignes des influences climatiques polaires; cette aridification est accentu{\'{e}}e par l'effet dess{\'{e}}chant des masses continentales environnantes. Cet ass{\`{e}}chement climatique progressif s'est trouv{\'{e}} combin{\'{e}} avec un r{\'{e}}tr{\'{e}}cissement graduel du bassin d{\^{u}} {\`{a}} la migration vers le nord de la zone de subduction de la plaque pal{\'{e}}o-Pacifique qui constituait sa marge m{\'{e}}ridionale. Apr{\`{e}}s le d{\'{e}}p{\^{o}}t du supergroupe du Cap dans le bassin pr{\'{e}}-Karoo, il y eut une p{\'{e}}riode de soul{\`{e}}vement et d'{\'{e}}rosion. A la m{\^{e}}me {\'{e}}poque la partie m{\'{e}}ridionale du continent de Gondwana se d{\'{e}}pla{\c{c}}ait par-del{\`{a}} le p{\^{o}}le sud, ce qui provoque le d{\'{e}}veloppement d'une immense nappe glaciaire sur le bassin de Karoo naissant et sur les hauteurs environnantes. La s{\'{e}}dimentation glaciaire dans les vall{\'{e}}es montagneuses et sur la plate-forme continentale aboutit {\`{a}} la Formation {\`{a}} la base de la Formation du Karoo. Apr{\'{e}}s la glaciation sur la plate-forme continentale soumise {\`{a}} une faible subsidence, une mer bordi{\`{e}}re {\'{e}}tendue subsista, abondamment nourrie par les eaux de fonte. Des argiles et boues noires s'accumul{\`{e}}rent alors sous des conditions climatiques relativement froides (Ecca inf{\'{e}}rieur), avec peut-{\^{e}}tre un “interglaciaire” plus chaud durant lequel se d{\'{e}}pos{\`{e}}rent les shales carbonat{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} Mesosaurus de la Formation de Whitehill. La d{\'{e}}formation du rebord sud du bassin, provoqu{\'{e}}e par la subduction de la plaque pal{\'{e}}o-Pacifique, aboutit {\`{a}} la formation de cha{\^{i}}nes montagneuses loin au sud. Le mat{\'{e}}riel provenant de cette source ainsi que des hauteurs granitiques de l'ouest et du nord-est se d{\'{e}}pose sur les vastes deltas qui s'{\'{e}}difi{\`{e}}rent dans lam mer d'Ecca (Ecca sup{\'{e}}rieur). Le climate relativement froid et la faible altitude entra{\^{i}}n{\`{e}}rent alors d'{\'{e}}paisses accumulations de tourbe sur les plaines c{\^{o}}ti{\`{e}}res et delta{\"{i}}ques, qui constituent actuellement les plus grandes r{\'{e}}serves de charbon de l'Afrique m{\'{e}}ridionale. Plus tard, des deltas connurent une progradation telle que leur coalescence combla la plus grande partie du bassin, apr{\`{e}}s quoi la s{\'{e}}dimentation fluviatile domina la formation du groupe de Beaufort. A cette {\'{e}}poque (Permien sup{\'{e}}rieur) le climat s'{\'{e}}tait r{\'{e}}chauff{\'{e}} pour devenir semi-aride avec des pr{\'{e}}cipitations fortement saisonni{\'{e}}res. Les parties centrales du bassin furent pour la plupart drain{\'{e}}es par des ceintures de m{\'{e}}andres {\`{a}} s{\'{e}}diments fins et par des lacs semi-permanents. Des r{\'{e}}serves significatives d'uranium s{\'{e}}dimentaire se sont trouv{\'{e}}es d{\'{e}}limit{\'{e}}es dans le gr{\`{e}}s des chenaux du groupe de Beaufort dans le sud-ouest du bassin. Des pulsations de soul{\`{e}}vement dans les zones d'alimentation m{\'{e}}ridionales, combin{\'{e}}es avec un possible effet orog{\'{e}}nique, provoqu{\`{e}}rent la progradation de deux c{\^{o}}nes alluviaux {\`{a}} s{\'{e}}dimentation grossi{\`{e}}re dans les parties plus centrales du bassin (Katberg Sandstone Member et Molteno Formation). Au sommet de la s{\'{e}}quence du Karoo, l'aridification progressive a une influence pr{\'{e}}pond{\'{e}}rante sur le style des d{\'{e}}p{\^{o}}ts avec des milieux de playas et d'oueds (Elliot Formation) quie enfin firent place {\`{a}} un syst{\`{e}}me domin{\'{e}} par des sables dunaires (Clarens Formation).

@article{Heydari2003b,
abstract = {The uppermost Permian strata of the Abadeh section in Iran consist of 56 m of skeletal limestone (Abadehian), that grades upward into 18 m of grey, bioturbated lime mudstone (Djulfian), which in turn grades upward to 18 m of red, nodular wackestone (Dorashamian) containing an abundant pelagic fauna. The overlying lowermost Triassic includes two enigmatic layers at its base. Immediately above the boundary is a 1-m-thick layer of inorganically precipitated synsedimentary carbonate cement. The cement is composed of 10-20-cm-long crystals oriented either perpendicular to the bedding or as dome-shaped features resembling botryoids. About 0.5 m of wackestone overlies the cement layer. The second layer is a 1.5-m-thick grainstone overlying the cement horizon and consists of recrystallised spherical grains (ooids or peloids). The remainder of unit 'A' is composed of 100+ m of grey, bioturbated to nodular lime mudstone. The lithofacies succession of the uppermost Permian is interpreted to represent deposition under increasing water depth, related to rising of relative sea level, which led to drowning of the carbonate platform to below storm wave base. Sedimentologic characteristics, lithology, wide distribution, and slow sedimentation rates indicate that strata immediately below the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary (Dorashamian interval) were deposited in deep, oxygenated waters. The enigmatic lowermost Triassic synsedimentary carbonate cement and grainstone layers are interpreted to have been deposited in shallow waters, indicating a rapid and major drop in relative sea level at the end of Permian time in this area, followed by a relative sea-level rise during the earliest Triassic. Precipitation of synsedimentary cement immediately above the P-T boundary in Iran and elsewhere (South China) suggests a global change in ocean chemistry. One possible explanation is that dissolved calcium and bicarbonate concentrations in seawater increased sufficiently to promote spontaneous carbonate precipitation, a rare event in the Phanerozoic but common during Precambrian time. Alternatively, a massive heating event could have resulted in CO2 degassing and decreases in oceanic carbonate solubility, both leading to inorganic, synsedimentary carbonate precipitation. Inorganic precipitation of synsedimentary carbonate cement may indicate that biochemical production of carbonate was halted due to the P-T boundary events. Our study indicates that shallow and moderately deep waters during the latest Permian were well oxygenated in the open ocean setting of the central Tethys Sea in Iran. Therefore, P-T mass extinction scenarios that invoke upon widespread marine anoxia should be viewed with caution. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The late Early Triassic sedimentary-facies evolution and carbonate carbon-isotope marine record (??13Ccarb) of ammonoid-rich, outer platform settings show striking similarities between the South China Block (SCB) and the widely distant Northern Indian Margin (NIM). The studied sections are located within the Triassic Tethys Himalayan belt (Losar section, Himachal Pradesh, India) and the Nanpanjiang Basin in the South China Block (Jinya section, Guangxi Province), respectively. Carbon isotopes from the studied sections confirm the previously observed carbon cycle perturbations at a time of major paleoceanographic changes in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis. This study documents the coincidence between a sharp increase in the carbon isotope composition and the worldwide ammonoid evolutionary turnover (extinction followed by a radiation) occurring around the Smithian-Spathian boundary. Based on recent modeling studies on ammonoid paleobiogeography and taxonomic diversity, we demonstrate that the late Early Triassic (Smithian and Spathian) was a time of a major climate change. More precisely, the end Smithian climate can be characterized by a warm and equable climate underlined by a flat, pole-to-equator, sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, while the steep Spathian SST gradient suggests latitudinally differentiated climatic conditions. Moreover, sedimentary evidence suggests a transition from a humid and hot climate during the Smithian to a dryer climate from the Spathian onwards. By analogy with comparable carbon isotope perturbations in the Late Devonian, Jurassic and Cretaceous we propose that high atmospheric CO2 levels could have been responsible for the observed carbon cycle disturbance at the Smithian-Spathian boundary. We suggest that the end Smithian ammonoid extinction has been essentially caused by a warm and equable climate related to an increased CO2 flux possibly originating from a short eruptive event of the Siberian igneous province. This increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations could have additionally reduced the marine calcium carbonate oversaturation and weakened the calcification potential of marine organisms, including ammonoids, in late Smithian oceans. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The dominance of lower-molecular-weight n-alkanes in the samples from the section suggests that algae and bacteria were the dominant contributors to the organic fraction preserved in this marine section, with bacteria particularly enhanced within the stromatolite. The end-Permian biotic crisis coincided with a short-term suppression of autotrophs, indicated by the ratio of pristane (Pr) and phytane (Ph) to C17 and C18n-alkanes, and proliferation of heterotrophs, shown by the ratio of branched-to-normal C17 alkanes. The biotic crisis also may have been associated with a transient oxygenation event in the shallow marine, indicated by elevated Pr/Ph ratios and lowered C27 18$\alpha$(H)-22,29,30-Trisnorneohopane (Ts) to C27 17$\alpha$(H)-22,29,30-Trisnorhopane (Tm) and gammacerane ($\gamma$) to C31 homohopane (C31HP) ratios.

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge is defined as any flow of water at continental margins from the seabed to the coastal ocean, regardless of fluid composition or driving force1. The flux of submarine groundwater discharge has been hypothesized to be a pathway for enriching coastal waters in nutrients, carbon and metals2. Here, we estimate the submarine groundwater flux from the inventory of 228Ra in the upper Atlantic Ocean, obtained by interpolating measurements at over 150 stations. Only 46{\%} of the loss in 228Ra from radioactive decay is replenished by input from dust, rivers and coastal sediments. We infer that the remainder must come from submarine groundwater discharge. Using estimates of 228Ra concentrations in submarine groundwater discharge, we arrive at a total flux from submarine groundwater discharge of 2–41013 m3 yr- 1, between 80 and 160{\%} of the amount of freshwater entering the Atlantic Ocean from rivers. Submarine groundwater discharge is not a freshwater flux, but a flux of terrestrial and sea water that has penetrated permeable coastal sediments. Our assessment of the volume of submarine groundwater discharge confirms that this flux represents an important vehicle for the delivery of nutrients, carbon and metal to the ocean.},

abstract = {Here, we present the palynological record from two shallow core holes (6611/09-U-01 and -02) from the Tr{\o}ndelag Platform offshore mid-Norway consisting of 750 m of Upper Permian and Lower Triassic sediments. The relatively homogeneous assemblages recovered from the Upper Permian deposits are dominated by gymnosperm pollen, mainly pteridosperms. At the base of the Griesbachian, numerous spore species appear in the record, leading to an increased diversity. The change at this boundary is also marked by the massive reduction of one group of pteridosperm pollen (Vittatina). Together with other typical Permian elements (e.g., Lueckisporites virkkiae), this group is rare but consistently present in the lower part of the Griesbachian, and it gradually disappears in its upper part. The distribution of other groups such as taeniate and non-taeniate bisaccate gymnosperm pollen (pterido sperms and conifers) shows no significant change across the boundary, whereas spores and other gymnosperm pollen increase in diversity and abundance. These changes coincide with the formational change between the Schuchert Dal Formation (Upper Permian) and the Wordie Creek Formation (Griesbachian) equivalents. Late Permian and Griesbachian palynomorph assemblages display different patterns. The former show a homogeneous composition of low diversity, whereas the latter reflect diverse and variably composed floras. The data suggest that the arid phase of the Late Permian was followed by a humid phase at the base of the Griesbachian. In the Griesbachian section, a succession of six distinct palyno logical assemblages (phase II-VII) can be inferred. Comparable changes have been described from East Greenland. The variations in the palynological record are interpreted to reflect changing ecological conditions (e.g., changing humidity). Comparable variations in the distribution of 13C isotope values reported from various sections from Greenland and China, showing stable values during the Late Permian and highly variable values during the Griesbachian, suggest common causes for the observed fluctuations. Multiphase volcanic activity of the Siberian traps seems to be the most likely candidate to have caused the variations in the 13C isotope as well as in the palynological record. In contrast to the common claim that marine and terrestrial biota both suffered a mass extinction related to the Permian-Triassic boundary event, the studied material from the Norwegian midlatitudinal sites shows no evidence for destruction of plant ecosystems. The presence of diverse microfloras of Griesbachian age supports the idea that the climate in this area allowed most plants to survive the Permian-Triassic boundary event. {\textcopyright} 2010 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The pyritization of reactive trace elements in different anoxic marine sediments was investigated to determine the importance of factors such as [summation operator]H2S, reactive-Fe, pyrite content and salinity in controlling this process. The areas studied included anoxic-sulfidic sediments (Baffin Bay, a hypersaline coastal lagoon from Texas and Green Canyon, a hemipelagic oil seepage area), anoxic-nonsulfidic sediments with high sedimentation rates (Atchafalaya Bay-Mississippi Delta system), hemipelagic anoxic-nonsulfidic sediments with low sedimentation rates (Gulf of Mexico shelf and slope and Orca Basin, an euxinic hypersaline basin) and organic-rich marsh sediments (Atchafalaya Bay). Results indicate that the degree of trace metal pyritization (DTMP) of all trace metals, except Cd, increased with increasing degree of pyritization (DOP), irrespective of the type of sedimentary environment involved. However, for As, Hg and Mo, the values were generally above the 1:1 ratio line, whereas the transition metals Co, Cu, Mn and Ni displayed a close to linear increase in DTMP with DOP and moderate incorporation into pyrite. Chromium and the class B metals Pb and Zn were also gradually incorporated into the pyrite phase but without reaching the DTMP levels exhibited by the transition metals. Cadmium was not incorporated to a significant extent. These results are consistent with the chemical attributes of these different classes of trace elements. Availability of dissolved trace metals and organic matter content are apparently important factors controlling the incorporation of Co, Cr, Cu and Ni into pyrite in anoxicsulfidic (Fe-poor and H2S-rich) environments.},

abstract = {Stromatolites date back some 3.5 billion years and constitute the most common and conspicuous fossils through the Proterozoic. These organosedimentary structures decreased dramatically in diversity and abundance by the late Neoproterozoic, a phenomenon often ascribed to destructive grazing by newly evolved metazoans. We investigated the concurrent processes of microbial calcification and metazoan bioerosion in one of the few locations (Rio Mesquites, Cuatro Ci{\'{e}}negas, Coahuila, Mexico) where living freshwater stromatolites, formed by cyanobacteria and diatoms, coexist with significant populations of metazoan grazers. We used microsensor chemical profiling and monitoring of bulk water Ca2+ concentrations to determine calcification rates and their dependence on microbial metabolism. The bioerosive impact resulting from grazing by endemic hydrobiid gastropods was assessed by gravimetric quantification of carbonaceous faecal pellet production. Calcification was clearly light-dependent, reaching maximal rates (saturation) at low incident light intensity, and was surprisingly efficient, with O2/Ca2+ exchange ratios well above unity, and with absolute rates similar to those found in corals. However, the erosive action of grazing snails removed most of these carbonate inputs from the oncolites. Thus, a precarious balance between constructive and destructive geobiological processes was at play in the system. The fact that accretion barely exceeded bioerosion in an environment highly conducive to calcification supports the potential impact of faunal grazing as causal agent in the demise of stromatolites in the late Proterozoic. Our findings indicate that a search for fossil evidence of bioerosive grazing in the form of carbonaceous faecal pellets associated with fossil stromatolites may provide a means to test that hypothesis directly.},

abstract = {We review available data constraining the extent, volume, age and duration of all major Phanerozoic continental flood basalts (CFB or traps) and oceanic plateaus (OP), together forming the group of large igneous provinces (LIP), going from the smallest Columbia flood basalts at ???16 Ma to the as yet ill-known remnants of a possible trap at ???360 Ma in eastern Siberia. The 16 traps (CFB and OP) reviewed form a rather unimodal distribution with an initial modal volume of the order of 2.5 Mkm3. Most provinces agree with a rather simple first order model in which volcanism may have lasted of the order of 10 Ma, often resulting in continental break-up, but where most of the volume was erupted in about 1 Ma or sometimes less. This makes CFBs/OPs (LIPs) major geodynamic events, with fluxes exceeding the total output of present day hot spots and even possibly exceeding over short times the entire crustal production of mid-ocean ridges. The proposed correlation between trap ages and the ages of several geological events, including mass extinctions and oceanic anoxia, is found to have improved steadily as more data have become available, to the point that the list of trap ages may coincide with many major divisions in the geological time scale. The four largest mass extinctions in the last 260 Ma coincide to the best resolution available with four traps, making a causal connection between the two through some form of catastrophic climatic perturbations the most likely hypothesis. The time sequence of LIPs appears to have been random and there is no robust evidence for long time trends in the corresponding crustal production rate over the last 260 Ma. ?? 2003 Acad??mie des sciences/??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.

The Latest Permian transgression in the Sverdrup Basin of Arctic Canada initiated prior to onset of deep-water anoxia and continued past the Latest Permian Extinction event. Deep-water anoxia initiated after the shelf was flooded in mid to Late Changhsingian time, requiring a much more rapid, and much greater vertical, rise in the chemocline than that associated with relative sea level, supporting the chemocline upward excursion model. Our work also extends evidence of global euxinc conditions to NW Pangea. Euxinic conditions developed just prior to the main extinction event, and we suggest that this was associated with a significant pyrite rain-out event which stripped bio-essential nutrients from anoxic seawater prior to the main disruption of the global carbon cycle, as recorded by shifts in the carbon isotope record.

We present a very different global climate record determined by ion microprobe oxygen isotope analyses of Early Ordovician-Silurian conodonts. This record shows a steady cooling trend through the Early Ordovician reaching modern equatorial temperatures that were sustained throughout the Middle and Late Ordovician. This favorable climate regime implies not only that the oxygen isotopic composition of Ordovician seawater was similar to that of today, but also that climate played an overarching role in promoting the unprecedented increases in biodiversity that characterized this period.},

abstract = {Models of mass extinctions caused by greenhouse warming depend on the ability of warming to affect the oxygenation of the ocean, either through slowing circulation or changes in biological productivity and the organic carbon budget. Opal Creek, Alberta, Canada is a biostratigraphically continuous Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) section deposited in deep water on an outer shelf setting in the vast and understudied Panthalassic Ocean, along the western margin of Pangaea. The latest-Permian extinction is here represented as the disappearance of the previously dominant benthic fauna (siliceous sponges). On the basis of nitrogen and reduced sulfur isotopes as well as productivity-sensitive trace elements, the Middle Permian at Opal Creek is interpreted as a highly productive coastal upwelling zone where vigorous denitrification and sulfate reduction occurred in a mid-water oxygen minimum. Similar conditions appear to have continued into the latest Permian until the onset of a euxinic episode represented by a discrete pyrite bed and several trace element indicators of high productivity. This euxinic pulse is followed by the extinction of benthic fauna and a shift in nitrogen and sulfur isotopes to more normal marine values, suggesting the cessation of coastal upwelling and the consequent weakening of the mid-water oxygen minimum. The Lower Triassic appears to be a dysoxic, relatively unproductive environment with a bottom water oxygen minimum. Rhenium-osmium isotope systematics show a minimum of radiogenic Os near the main extinction event, which may be due to volcanic input, and increasingly radiogenic values approaching the PTB, possibly due to increased continental erosion. The Opal Creek system demonstrates that, while the biogeochemical crisis in the latest Permian was capable of impacting the coastal upwelling modality of ocean circulation, a transient increase in productivity likely drove the system toward euxinia and, ultimately, extinction. 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Land-plant productivity was greatly reduced after the end-Permian mass extinction, causing a pronounced "coal gap" worldwide during the Early Triassic. Newly obtained organic geochemistry data from the Chaohu area, south China, indicated an abrupt and profound terrestrial vegetation change over the middle part of the Early Triassic Smithian-Spathian (S-S) interval. Herbaceous lycopsids and/or bryophytes dominated terrestrial vegetation from Griesbachian to Smithian times. The terrestrial ecosystem underwent an abrupt change, and woody conifers became dominant over the S-S interval. Several important biomarkers, namely retene, simonellite, and dehydroabietane (with multiple sources: conifer, lycopsid, and/or herbaceous bryophyte), were relatively abundant during Griesbachian, Dienerian, and Smithian times. The relatively low C/N ratio values during the Griesbachian-Smithian interval indicate that these biomarkers were likely sourced from herbaceous lycopsids and/or bryophytes. The extremely abundant conifer-sourced pimanthrene, combined with relatively high C/N ratio values, suggested the recovery of woody conifers after the S-S boundary. The new data revealed that the switch from herbaceous vegetation to woody coniferous vegetation marked a terrestrial plant recovery, which occurred globally within 3 million years after the end-Permian crisis rather than at a later date estimated in previous studies. In Chaohu, the S-S terrestrial event was marked by a reappearance of woody vegetation, while the S-S marine event was marked by an increase in ichnodiversity, trace complexity, burrow size, infaunal tiering level, and bioturbation level, and a possible intense upwelling event indicated by the extended tricyclic terpane ratios (ETR). Coeval vegetation changes with comparable patterns have also been documented in Europe and Pakistan based on palynologic studies. The S-S boundaries in Asia and Europe are associated with a positive $\delta$13C excursion, the rebound of woody vegetation, a turnover of ammonoid faunas, and possible global climate cooling. This is the first study to document the S-S event using biomarkers and C/N ratios. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Paleomagnetic and paleoclimatic data provide the most useful latitudinal constraints for plate reconstructions. Distributions through the Paleozoic of five types of climatically sensitive sediments (coals, evaporites, reefs, dolomites and limestones) for south China, north China and Tarim are shown on 15 maps that include 1578 reliable data points. These paleoclimatic data agree reasonably well with available paleomagnetic directions, although significant divergence between the two exists for the Early Paleozoic. These data indicate the following: (1) South China was in low latitudes during the entire Paleozoic, with a subtropical position in the Cambrian. (2) North China also remained near the equator in the Early and Late Paleozoic, except for the Ordovian and the Late Permian when extensive evaporites suggest slightly higher latitudinal positions, while its Middle Paleozoic position is uncertain due to the missing stratigraphic record. (3) In south China, local tectonics appears to have played a dominant role in determining paleogeography and therefore marine sedimentation, especially after the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian, because the areal coverage of marine sediments through time is distinctly different from what would be expected from published global sea-level curves. (4) Paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic data are compatible with biogeographic data which suggest that south China was part of eastern Gondwana in the Early Paleozoic, but was widely separated from Gondwana in the Late Paleozoic, and the split between the two probably happened in the Devonian, giving rise to a major break-up unconformity in central south China.},

abstract = {Sr concentrations in Phanerozoic biological calcite suggest a close link between fluctuations in the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater, aragonite versus calcite sedimentation, and the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater, the entire chain being driven by the rate of production and hydrothermal alteration of the oceanic crust. Model simulations suggest that variations in hydrothermal and continental weathering fluxes cannot be the sole reason for the observed Phanerozoic seawater Sr/Ca trend. Changing Sr burial in marine carbonates is likely the most important mechanism that can explain the experimental data. During episodes of high seawater Mg/Ca ratios, aragonite was preferentially deposited, resulting in low seawater Sr/Ca ratios. At low Mg/Ca ratios, calcite was the dominant carbonate sediment, and the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater was high. The evidence for changing chemistry of seawater also has implications for the application of the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca paleothermometers, in particular for pre-Quaternary samples, and for the assessment of diagenetic alteration of fossil skeletal carbonates by using Sr/Ca ratios.},

abstract = {The sulfur isotopic composition of carbonate associated sulfate (CAS) has been used to investigate the geochemistry of ancient seawater sulfate. However, few studies have quantified the reliability of $\delta$34S of CAS as a seawater sulfate proxy, especially with respect to later diagenetic overprinting. Pyrite, which typically has depleted $\delta$34S values due to authigenic fractionation associated with bacterial sulfate reduction, is a common constituent of marine sedimentary rocks. The oxidation of pyrite, whether during diagenesis or sample preparation, could thus adversely influence the sulfur isotopic composition of CAS. Here, we report the results of CAS extractions using HCl and acetic acid with samples spiked with varying amounts of pyrite. The results show a very strong linear relationship between the abundance of fine-grained pyrite added to the sample and the resultant abundance and $\delta$34S value of CAS. This data represents the first unequivocal evidence that pyrite is oxidized during the CAS extraction process. Our mixing models indicate that in samples with much less than 1 wt.{\%} pyrite and relatively high $\delta$34Spyrite values, the isotopic offset imparted by oxidation of pyrite should be much less than −4‰. Awealth of literature exists on the oxidation of pyrite by Fe3+ and we believe this mechanism drives the oxidation of pyrite during CAS extraction, during which the oxygen used to form sulfate is taken from H2O, not O2. Consequently, extracting CAS under anaerobic conditions would only slow, but not halt, the oxidation of pyrite. Future studies of CAS should attempt to quantify pyrite abundance and isotopic composition. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {The coastal upwelling system off central Namibia is one of the most productive regions of the oceans and is characterized by frequently occurring shelf anoxia with severe effects for the benthic life and fisheries. We present data on water column dissolved oxygen, sulfide, nitrate and nitrite, pore water profiles for dissolved sulfide and sulfate, 
                        35S-sulfate reduction rates, as well as bacterial counts of large sulfur bacteria from 20 stations across the continental shelf and slope. The stations covered two transects and included the inner shelf with its anoxic and extremely oxygen-depleted bottom waters, the oxygen minimum zone on the continental slope, and the lower continental slope below the oxygen minimum zone. High concentrations of dissolved sulfide, up to 22 mM, in the near-surface sediments of the inner shelf result from extremely high rates of bacterial sulfate reduction and the low capacity to oxidize and trap sulfide. The inner shelf break marks the seaward border of sulfidic bottom waters, and separates two different regimes of bacterial sulfate reduction. In the sulfidic bottom waters on the shelf, up to 55{\%} of sulfide oxidation is mediated by the large nitrate-storing sulfur bacteria, Thiomargarita spp. The filamentous relatives Beggiatoa spp. occupy low-O
                        2 bottom waters on the outer shelf. Sulfide oxidation on the slope is apparently not mediated by the large sulfur bacteria. The data demonstrate the importance of large sulfur bacteria, which live close to the sediment-water interface and reduce the hydrogen sulfide flux to the water column. Modeling of pore water sulfide concentration profiles indicates that sulfide produced by bacterial sulfate reduction in the uppermost 16 cm of sediment is sufficient to account for the total flux of hydrogen sulfide to the water column. However, the total pool of hydrogen sulfide in the water column is too large to be explained by steady state diffusion across the sediment-water interface. Episodic advection of hydrogen sulfide, possibly triggered by methane eruptions, may contribute to hydrogen sulfide in the water column. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

The degree of bioturbation is examined for radiolarian chert successions in central Japan with the reassessment of geochemical proxies to evaluate the degree of palaeo-oxygenation of a pelagic oceanic bottom. No evidence for anoxia is found from Wuchiapingian and lower Changhsingian chert by the reassessment of geochemical proxies. Anoxia started from the late Changhsingian stage that was interrupted by an oxygenation event at the supposed PT boundary. Griesbachian to the earliest Smithian, being characterised by the occurrence of black carbonaceous claystone, is an anoxic interval with rare bioturbation in the early part and is oxygenated in the later part. Succeeding grey siliceous claystone of early Smithian represents largely an anoxic interval, but it is oxygenated in the later part of this stage. Grey siliceous claystone with black carbonaceous claystone interbeds of Spathian was suboxic to oxic, and temporal anoxia being caused mainly by high productivity intermittently was established within a short time interval. Red chert is rather common in Anisian, but unusual sedimentation of organic matter still continued until the latest Anisian. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Porewater concentrations of sulfate, methane, and other relevant constituents were determined on four sediment cores from the high productivity upwelling area off Namibia which were recovered from the continental slope at water depths of 1300 and 2000 m. At all four stations a distinct sulfate-methane transition zone was observed several meters below the seafloor in which both sulfate and methane are consumed. Nutrient porewater concentration profiles do not show gradient slope changes at the depths of the transition zones. Flux calculations carried out on the basis of the determined porewater profiles revealed that anaerobic methane oxidation accounts for 100{\%} of deep sulfate reduction within the sulfate-methane transition zone and consumes the total net diffusive sulfate flux. A significant contribution of organic carbon oxidation to the reduction of sulfate at these depths could, therefore, be excluded. We state that porewater profiles of sulfate with constant gradients above the transition zones are indicative for anaerobic methane oxidation controlling sulfate reduction.},

abstract = {The black shale submember of core shales of Pennsylvanian Kansas-type cyclothems is highly enriched in redox-sensitive trace elements (TEs) relative to the overlying gray shale submember as well as to many other modern and ancient organic-rich deposits. Controls on trace-element behavior in the black shale can be inferred from trace-element enrichment factors (EFs, relative to gray shale) and the relationship of TEs to total organic carbon (TOC). Most TEs conformed to one of two patterns: (1) Mo, U, V, Zn, and Pb exhibited moderate EFs and strong covariation with TOC in samples having {\textless}10 wt.{\%} TOC but large EFs and weak covariation with TOC in samples having {\textgreater}10 wt.{\%} TOC; and (2) Cu, Ni, Cr, and Co exhibited low EFs and moderate to strong covariation with TOC in all samples. These patterns are inferred to represent different responses to benthic redox conditions. The first pattern is characteristic of TEs of "strong euxinic affinity", i.e., those taken up in solid solution by Fe-sulfide or involved in other reactions catalyzed by free H2S, and resident mainly in authigenic phases, whereas the second pattern is characteristic of TEs of "weak euxinic affinity", i.e., those not strongly influenced by the presence of free H2S and resident mainly in the organic carbon or detrital fractions of the sediment. These inferences allowed development of a multiproxy technique for assessing redox facies in black shale samples: euxinic conditions were considered to have existed if at least two of four "redox-indicator" trace elements (Mo, U, V, Zn) showed euxinic levels of enrichment, and nonsulfidic anoxic conditions were inferred otherwise. The validity of the procedure is indicated by (1) agreement among all four "redox indicators" for a large majority of samples (69{\%} of 185); (2) among samples yielding a mixed redox signal, a systematic sequence of TE enrichment (V???Zn???Mo???U); and (3) for TEs of "weak euxinic affinity", reduced variance among samples representing each redox facies. Sequential enrichment may be a response to differential redox thresholds for accumulation (e.g., V) or postdepositional remobilization of trace elements (e.g., U) and may provide a basis for finer assessment of redox conditions in low-oxygen paleoenvironments than permitted by simple classification schemes. The multiproxy procedure for redox-facies analysis developed in this study is likely to be more reliable than widely used single-proxy indicators based on trace elements (e.g., Mo, authigenic U, or V/(V+Ni)) or C-S-Fe systematics (e.g., S/TOC or DOP). ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The use of stable isotopes to solve biogeochemical problems in ecosystem analysis is increasing rapidly because stable isotope data can contribute both source-sink (tracer) and process information. The elements C, N, S, H, and 0 all have more than one isotope, and isotopic compositions of natural materials can be measured with great precision with a mass spectrometer. Isotopic compositions change in predictable ways as elements cycle through the biosphere. These changes have been exploited by geochemists to understand the global elemental cycles. Ecologists have not until quite recently employed these techniques. The reasons for this are, first, that most ecologists do not have the background in chemistry and geochemistry to be fully aware of the possibilities for exploiting the natural variations in stable isotopic composi- tions, and second, that stable isotope ratio measurements require equipment not normally available to ecologists. This is unfortunate because some of the more intractable problems in ecology can be profitably addressed using stable isotope measurements. Stable isotopes are ideally suited to increase our understanding of element cycles in ecosystems. This review is written for ecologists who would like to learn more about how stable isotope analyses have been and can be used in ecosystem studies. We begin with an explanation of isotope terminology and fractionation, then summarize isotopic distributions in the C, N, and S biogeochemical cycles, and conclude with five case studies that show how stable isotope measure- ments can provide crucial information for ecosystem analysis. We restrict this review to studies of natural variations in C, N, and S isotopic abundances, excluding from consideration '5N enrichment studies and hydrogen and oxy- gen isotope studies. Our focus on C, N, and S derives in part from our experience that combinations of these measurements are often complementary and in part from the need to limit the scope of the review.},

abstract = {We present an empirical calibration of the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer based on mollusk and brachiopod shells from natural and controlled environments spanning water temperatures of −1.0 to 29.5°C. The clumped isotope data ($\Delta$47) are normalized to CO2 gases with equilibrium distributions of clumped isotopologues at high temperature (1000°C) and low temperature (27 or 30°C), and thus the calibration is unique in being directly referenced to a carbon dioxide equilibrium reference frame (Dennis et al., 2011, Defining an absolute reference frame for clumped isotope studies of CO2, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 75, 7117–7131). The shell clumped isotope data define the following relation as a function of temperature (in kelvin): $\Delta$47=0.0327×106/T2+0.3286(r2=0.84).The temperature sensitivity (slope) of this relation is lower than those based on corals, fish otoliths, foraminifera, and coccoliths, but is similar to theoretical predictions for calcite based on lattice dynamics calculations. We find no convincing methodological or biological explanations for the difference in temperature sensitivity between this calibration and the previous calibrations, and suggest that the discrepancy might represent real but unknown differences in mineral–DIC clumped isotope fractionation between mollusks/brachiopods and other taxa. Nevertheless, revised analytical methods similar to those used in this study are now in wide use, and it will be important to develop calibrations for other taxonomic groups using these updated methods, with analyses directly referenced to the carbon dioxide equilibrium reference frame.},

abstract = {Micro-crystalline barites recovered by deep-sea drilling from Site 684 on the Peru margin and Site 799 in the Japan Sea are highly enriched in the heavy sulfur isotope relative to seawater ($\delta$34S up to +84‰). This isotopic composition is consistent with remobilization of biogenic barite triggered by sulfate reduction, and subsequent reprecipitation as a diagenetic barite front. The high levels of barium sulfate in these deposits (10-50{\%}) cannot be explained by a diffusive transport model in sediments experiencing a constant rate of sedimentation. When sedimentation rates change radically, the barite front will remain at a given depth interval leading to large accumulations of barium sulfate. Such conditions may have generated the barite deposits at Site 799. At Site 684, on the other hand, there is evidence that the barite deposits are a result of the tectonically-driven advection of sulfate-bearing fluids through the sediment column.},

On the basis of the data presented, reconstructions of the region have been prepared that take account of the known major movements of continental masses. These reconstructions show some striking features, many of which were poorly appreciated previously in the evolution of the region. With the disappearance of the Hercynian Ocean, the floor of the High-Zagros Alpine Ocean started to subduct beneath southern Central Iran and apparently disappeared by Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene time. From this time the compressional motion between Arabia and Eurasia has been accommodated in Iran by shortening and thickening of the continental crust. This crustal thickening is accompanied by a progressive, though eventful, transition from marine to continental conditions. A striking feature highlighted in this study is the existence of extensive alkaline and calc-alkaline volcanics, which appear to be unrelated to subduction. Refs.},

abstract = {Molybdenum (Mo) is a popular paleoproxy for tracking the spatiotemporal pattern of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) conditions in the ancient ocean, yet surprisingly little is known about the processes leading to its fixation under sulfidic conditions. Pyrite has been proposed to be the main host phase for Mo sequestration. To clarify the role played by pyrite, and thus to refine the utility of this paleoproxy, modern and ancient samples from six different study sites were analyzed, all representing euxinic conditions, using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Although pyrite often shows substantial enrichments relative to average crust and even matrix samples of similar size, our results show that most of the Mo in euxinic muds and shales is found in the non-pyrite matrix (80-100{\%}) and not in the pyrite grains (0-20{\%})-simply because the volume of matrix dominates the bulk sediments/rocks. A relationship between the percent of Mo hosted by pyrite and the sulfur isotope composition of that pyrite is observed and can be linked to post-depositional alteration. Specifically, the oldest, typically most altered samples, show the highest ??34S values because of limited sulfate availability at the time of their formation in the early ocean. In these old samples, the relatively small amount of Mo sequestered initially within pyrite is more likely to have been released to the matrix during the strong recrystallization overprints that these rocks have disproportionately suffered. Despite the universal importance of appreciable H2S availability during Mo uptake, we conclude that pyrite should be viewed as a nontrivial sink for Mo but clearly not the primary host in most euxinic shales and rather suggest that other burial pathways should be emphasized in future studies of the mechanisms of Mo sequestration in such settings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Geochemical proxies based on Fe abundance (Fe/Al) and Fe-speciation have been widely applied to marine sediments in order to unravel paleo-depositional redox conditions though geological time. To date, however, these Fe proxies have only been calibrated in relation to modern and ancient fine-grained siliciclastic marine sediments. This clearly limits their use, particularly in relation to carbonate-rich sediments and rocks. To address this, we here explore the applicability of Fe-based redox proxies in carbonates through three approaches. First, we have compiled Fe/Al data for modern marine sediments to investigate variability in Fe-enrichments as a function of carbonate content and depositional setting. Second, we have expanded this approach with a compilation of new and existing Fe-speciation data for modern and ancient marine sediments deposited under oxic and euxinic (anoxic sulfidic) water column conditions. Finally, we show new data from paired limestone and dolomite sample sets to demonstrate the potential significance of deep burial dolomitization on the Fe-speciation redox proxy. Modern marine sediments deposited under oxic conditions show no relationship between Fe/Al and carbonate content. These sediments have an average Fe/Al ratio of 0.55±0.11, with some higher values potentially being attributable to steady-state early diagenetic remobilization of Fe towards the sediment-water interface. In contrast, significant Fe/Al enrichments occur as a consequence of water column Fe mineral formation and deposition, either under anoxic conditions, or due to input of anoxic hydrothermal fluids into oxic seawater. Iron speciation data also show no direct correlation with carbonate content, and instead three groups can be distinguished based on total Fe (FeT) and organic C contents. Sediments deposited under oxic water column conditions, with FeT {\textgreater}0.5wt.{\%}, generally plot below the lower FeHR/FeT siliciclastic reference threshold (0.38) for distinguishing anoxic environments, regardless of carbonate content. Also consistent with siliciclastic calibrations, carbonate-rich sediments deposited under anoxic water column conditions tend to have FeHR/FeT ratios {\textgreater}0.38. In contrast, oxic carbonate-rich sediments with low FeT ({\textless}0.5wt.{\%}) and low organic C ({\textless}0.5wt.{\%}) routinely give spuriously high FeHR/FeT ratios, suggesting that the use of Fe-speciation for such samples is not appropriate for evaluating water column redox conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that an FeT content of {\textgreater}0.5wt.{\%}, rather than carbonate content, represents the most suitable basis for identifying whether carbonate-rich sediments are appropriate for Fe-based redox proxy analyses. Analysis of burial dolostones suggests that the Fe-speciation proxy may also be compromised by deep burial dolomitization, where there has been a source of mobile Fe to enrich rocks during recrystallization. However, pre-screening can identify such samples. This new assessment expands the utility of Fe-based redox proxies to also incorporate appropriate carbonate-rich rocks, provided that care is taken to assess the possible impact of deep burial dolomitization. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Coeval records of ocean, atmosphere, and terrestrial change are crucial to understanding the pattern and causes of global mass extinction across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). However, relationships among changes in different settings remain largely unclear, primarily due to the challenges associated with the correlation among disparate records. Here we compare marine carbon isotopic records with marine and terrestrial environmental and biotic events recorded in sediments from the Meishan PTB section of south China. Time-scaled carbonate carbon isotopes exhibit two gradual major shifts across the PTB at Meishan, and these are duplicable elsewhere around the Tethys Ocean. The two shifts are associated with two episodes of enhanced terrestrial weathering indicated by an increased abundance of 13C-enriched moretanes relative to hopanes and an elevated abundance of black carbon fragments. Key marine events previously reported for the PTB, including photic zone euxinia, faunal mass extinction, and cyanobacterial expansion, also occur as two episodes, coinciding with both of the progressive shifts to negative 13C values and enhanced weathering. The temporal sequence of the duplicable events suggests that the biotic crisis was a consequence of prolonged and episodic changes in the marine and continental systems, and argues against an extraterrestrial impact as the main cause. 2007 The Geological Society of America.},

This suggests reduced oxygen conditions, and the presence of H2S, is the cause of the end-Permian extinction. The Bulla section also shows three troughs in $\delta$34Ssulfate, of which the latter two coincide with the dysoxic–euxinic intervals. This suggests that the latter two $\delta$34Ssulfate troughs are the result of H2S oxidation in surface waters, but the first trough is the result of a different mechanism. We propose that H2S was oxidized in another region, either to low $\delta$34Ssulfate water or elemental S, which then moved to the Bulla area. At the Balvany section, Hungary, there are two $\delta$34Ssulfate troughs near the extinction and no evidence of euxinia. A similar mechanism to the first Bulla $\delta$34Ssulfate trough is proposed, with the suggestion that these waters were also depleted in oxygen in order to effect the extinction at Balvany.},

abstract = {Lower Triassic strata in the western United States and northern Italy have yielded the first reported occurrence of microbially mediated wrinkle structures in shallow subtidal siliciclastic paleoenvironments since the Cambrian. We hypothesize that wrinkle structures formed under reduced infaunalization conditions during the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. These wrinkle structures occur in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in association with hummocky cross-stratification and, in some cases, trace fossils such as Asteriacites, Rhizocorallium, Planolites, and Gyrochorte that indicate a subtidal paleoenvironment. Wrinkle structures were found in the Campil Member in the Werfen Formation of northern Italy and in the Virgin Limestone Member of the Moenkopi Formation and the upper member of the Thaynes Formation exposed in the western United States. The presence of wrinkle structures is likely related to a unique taphonomic window that allowed for the preservation of these delicate features on storm-dominated siliciclastic shelves. Wrinkle structures commonly formed in a variety of subtidal paleoenvironments during the Proterozoic-Cambrian, but thereafter became restricted to intertidalsupratidal and deep-sea environments. This restriction has been attributed to the increase in infaunalization of metazoans following the Cambrian radiation. The proliferation of wrinkle structures in subtidal settings during the Early Triassic suggests that infaunal bioturbation was reduced after the end-Permian mass extinction and that this reduction lasted for millions of years.},

abstract = {A major late Paleozoic depocentre, the Sverdrup Basin, Canadian High Arctic, has been largely left out of the latest Permian extinction debate, as early workers presumed Middle to Late Permian strata were absent. Basin-scale sequence-stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic correlations indicate Late Permian strata are only missing on the basin margins, where they were removed by sub-Triassic erosion, whereas continuous deposition is recorded in the basin centre. The varying degree of sub-Triassic erosion has significant impact on the carbon-isotope record across the Latest Permian Extinction event, where both the apparent rate and magnitude of carbon-isotope shift vary as a function of basin position. The intrabasin variability in apparent $\delta$13Corg shift across the event is equivalent to that observed globally. In contrast to the abrupt isotope shifts recorded on the basin margin, similar to many records reported globally, the basin centre section shows a systematic shift associated with the Latest Permian Extinction. The Earth likely underwent a prolonged period of increasing environmental stress leading up to the event.},

abstract = {The mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, ∼66 Ma, is thought to be caused by the impact of an asteroid at Chicxulub, present-day Mexico. Although the precise mechanisms that led to this mass extinction remain enigmatic, most postulated scenarios involve a short-lived global cooling, a so-called "impact winter" phase. Here we document a major decline in sea surface temperature during the first months to decades following the impact event, using TEX86 paleothermometry of sediments from the Brazos River section, Texas. We interpret this cold spell to reflect, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence for the effects of the formation of dust and aerosols by the impact and their injection in the stratosphere, blocking incoming solar radiation. This impact winter was likely a major driver of mass extinction because of the resulting global decimation of marine and continental photosynthesis.},

abstract = {Several characteristic geological features found on the surface of Mars by planetary rovers suggest that a possible extinct biosphere could exist based on similar sources of energy as occurred on Earth. For this reason, analytical instrumental protocols for the detection of biomarkers in suitable geological matrices unequivocally have to be elaborated for future unmanned explorations including the forthcoming ESA ExoMars mission. As part of the Pasteur suite of analytical instrumentation on ExoMars, the Raman/LIBS instrument will seek elemental and molecular information about geological, biological and biogeological markers in the Martian record. A key series of experiments on terrestrial Mars analogues, of which this paper addresses a particularly important series of compounds, is required to obtain the Raman spectra of key molecules and crystals, which are characteristic for each biomarker. Here, we present Raman spectra of several examples of organic compounds which have been recorded non-destructively--higher n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carotenoids, salts of organic acids, pure crystalline terpenes as well as oxygen-containing organic compounds. In addition, the lower limit of [beta]-carotene detection in sulphate matrices using Raman microspectroscopy was estimated.},

abstract = {We have determined (1) the abundance and isotopic composition of pyrite, monosulphide, elemental sulphur, organically bound sulphur, and dissolved sulphide; (2) the partition of ferric and ferrous iron; (3) the organic carbon contents of sediments recovered at two sites drilled on the Peru Margin during Leg 112 of the Ocean Drilling Program. Sediments at both sites are characterised by high levels of organically bound sulphur (OBS). OBS comprises up to 50{\%} of total sedimentary sulphur and up to 1{\%} of bulk sediment. The weight ratio of S to C in organic matter varies from 0.03 to 0.15 (mean = 0.10). Such ratios are like those measured in lithologically similar, but more deeply buried petroleum source rocks of the Monterey and Sisquoc formations in California. The sulphur content of organic matter is not limited by the availability of porewater sulphide. Isotopic data suggest that sulphur is incorporated into organic matter within a metre of the sediment surface, at least partly by reaction with polysulphides.  Most inorganic Sulphur occurs as pyrite. Pyrite formation occurred within surface sediments and was limited by the availability of reactive iron. But despite highly reducing sulphidic conditions, only 35–65{\%} of the total iron was converted to sulphide; 10–30{\%} of the total iron still occurs as Fe (III). In surface sediments, the isotopic composition of pyrite is similar to that of both iron monosulphide and dissolved sulphide. Either pyrite, like monosulphide, formed by direct reaction between dissolved sulphide and detrital iron, and/or the Sulphur species responsible for converting FeS to FeS2 is isotopically similar to dissolved sulphide. Likely stoichiometries for the reaction between ferric iron and excess sulphide imply a maximum resulting FeS2 :FeS ratio of 1:1. Where pyrite dominates the pool of iron sulphides, at least some pyrite must have formed by reaction between monosulphide and elemental sulphur and/or polysulphide. Elemental sulphur (S0) is most abundant in surface sediments and probably formed by oxidation of sulphide diffusing across the sediment-water interface. In surface sediments, S0 is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulphide, FeS and FeS2 and is unlikely to have been involved in the conversion of FeS to FeS2. Polysulphides are thus implicated as the link between FeS and FeS2.},

abstract = {At Site U1385, drilled during IODP Expedition 339 off the coast of Portugal on the continental slope, high-resolution sulfate concentration measurements in the pore fluids display non-steady-state behavior. At this site there is a zone of sulfate reduction in the uppermost seven meters of sediment, followed by a 38-meter interval where sulfate concentrations do not change, and finally sulfate concentrations are depleted to zero between 45 and 55. meters below seafloor. Below the sulfate minimum zone, there is abundant methane, suggesting that the lower sulfate consumption zone is coupled to anaerobic methane oxidation. We analyze pore water samples from IODP Site U1385 for sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of dissolved sulfate, as well as the sulfur isotope composition of sedimentary pyrite. The sulfur isotopes in pore fluid sulfate display similar non-steady-state behavior similar to that of the sulfate concentrations, increasing over the uppermost zone of sulfate reduction and again over the lower zone of sulfate-driven anaerobic methane oxidation. The oxygen isotopes in sulfate increase to the 'apparent equilibrium' value in the uppermost zone of sulfate reduction and do not change further. Our calculations support the idea that sulfite to sulfide reduction is the limiting step in microbial sulfate reduction, and that the isotope fractionation expressed in the residual pore water sulfate pool is inversely proportional to the net sulfate reduction rate. The sulfur isotope composition of pyrite acquires one value in the uppermost sediments, which may be overprinted by a second value in the deeper sediments, possibly due to iron release during anaerobic methane oxidation or iron diffusion from a higher zone of bacterial iron reduction. Our results have implications for modeling the sulfur isotope composition of the pyrite burial flux in the global biogeochemical sulfur cycle.},

By this "bio-ventilation" activity, the worm pushes the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) zone downward to the posterior end of its body, and simultaneously physically separates the sulfide produced during the anaerobic oxidation of methane from oxygen. While there is little scope for the AOM to take place in the tubeworm's body, 70{\%} of the sulfide that is produced by sulfate reduction processes or that is advected in the sediment is preferentially shunted via the organism where it is oxidised by endosymbionts providing the energy for the worm's growth. The process of sulfide reoxidation, occurring predominantly in the worm's body is thus very distinct from the anaerobic oxidation of methane, which is a diffuse process that takes place in the sediments in the methane-sulfate transition zone. We show how the sulfide oxidation process is affected by increasing densities and length of the frenulates, and by upward advection velocity. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Our biogeochemical model is one of the first to describe tubeworms explicitly.

abstract = {The Dinwoody Formation of the western United States represents an important archive of Early Triassic ecosystems in the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. We present a systematic description and a quantitative paleoecological analysis of its benthic faunas in order to reconstruct benthic associations and to explore the temporal and spatial variations of diversity, ecological structure and taxonomic composition throughout the earliest Triassic of the western United States. A total of 15 bivalve species, two gastropod species, and two brachiopod species are recognized in the study area. The paleoecological analysis shows that the oldest Dinwoody communities are characterized by low diversity, low ecological complexity and high dominance of few species. We suggest that this low diversity most likely reflects the consequences of the mass extinction in the first place and not necessarily the persistence of environmental stress. Whereas this diversity pattern persists into younger strata of the Dinwoody Formation in outer shelf environments, an increase in richness, evenness and guild diversity occurred around the Griesbachian-Dienerian boundary in more shallow marine habitats. This incipient recovery towards the end of the Griesbachian is in accordance with observations from other regions and thus probably represents an interregional signal. In contrast to increasing richness within communities (alpha-diversity), beta-diversity remained low during the Griesbachian and Dienerian in the study area. This low beta-diversity reflects a wide environmental and geographical range of taxa during the earliest Triassic, indicating that the increase of within-habitat diversity has not yet led to significant competitive exclusion. We hypothesize that the well-known prevalence of generalized taxa in post-extinction faunas is primarily an effect of reduced competition that allows species to exist through the full range of their fundamental niches, rather than being caused by unusual and uniform environmental stress.

Atmospheric pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was near 4500 ppm in the late Carnian, decreasing to below -2000 ppm by the late Rhaetian just before the earliest Jurassic eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, which triggered measurable pulses of CO2 outgassing. These data are consistent with published modeling results using the GEOCLIM model, which predict a decrease in pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} over the Late Triassic as a result of the progressive increase in continental area subject to the intense weathering regime of the tropical humid belt due to Pangea's northward motion. The finer-scale pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} changes we observe may be dependent on the lithology introduced to the tropics, such as the dip to -2000 ppm around 212 Ma and its rebound to -4000 ppm at 209 Ma, which can be accomplished by introducing a more weatherable subaerial basaltic terrain. These observations indicate that the consumption of CO2 by continental silicate weathering can force long-term changes in pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} comparable to those driven by presumed changes in mantle degassing.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {In the present study, we have investigated the C–S–Fe systematics in a sediment core (MD161- 13) from the Krishna-Godavari (K-G) basin, Bay of Bengal. The core covers the late Holocene period with high overall sedimentation rate of ?573 cm kyr21. Pore fluid chemical analyses indicate that the depth of the present sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ) is at ?6 mbsf. The (DTA1 DCa1DMg)/DSO22 4 ratios suggest that both organoclastic degradation and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) drive sulfate reduction at the study site. The positive correlation between total organic carbon content (TOC) and chro- mium reducible sulfur (CRS) content indicates marked influence of organoclastic sulfate reduction on sulfid- ization. Coupled occurrence of 34S-enriched iron sulfide (pyrite) with 12C-enriched authigenic carbonate zones is the possible records of paleo-sulfate methane transition zones where AOM-driven-focused sulfate reduction was likely fueled by sustained high methane flux from underlying gas-rich zone. Aluminum nor- malized poorly reactive iron (FePR/Al) and La/Yb ratios suggest increasing contribution from Deccan basalts relative to that of Archean-Proterozoic granitic complex in sediment flux of Krishna-Godavari basin during the last 4 kyr. 1.},

abstract = {Carbon cycle disturbance associated with mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period continued through the Early Triassic, an interval of approximately 5 million years. Coincidence of carbon cycle stabilization with accelerated Middle Triassic biotic recovery suggests a link between carbon cycling and biodiversity, but the cause of Early Triassic carbon isotope excursions remains poorly understood. Previous modeling studies have focused exclusively on the initial negative excursion in delta C-13 across the Permian-Triassic boundary and have not addressed the cycles of positive and negative excursions observed through the Early Triassic. This study uses a simple carbon cycle box model to investigate potential causes underlying the series of Early Triassic carbon isotope excursions and to assess possible relationships between isotope excursions and coeval patterns of carbonate deposition. According to the model, introduction of carbon with the isotope composition of volcanic CO2 produces small negative carbon isotope excursions followed by larger and more protracted positive excursions. Positive excursions result because increased pCO(2) causes warming, enhancing marine anoxia and associated regeneration of phosphate and thus allowing greater productivity. In addition, carbonate weathering is more sensitive than organic carbon weathering to changes in atmospheric pCO(2) and climate, causing an increase in the overall delta C-13 Composition of weathered carbon. Therefore, the full Early Triassic record of negative and positive carbon isotope excursions can only be accounted for within the model by several pulses of carbon release characterized by varying mixtures of organic and mantle isotope compositions. Thermal metamorphism of coal and carbonate rocks in the crust of the Siberian craton during eruption of the Siberian Traps flood basalts provides the most plausible mechanism for such a carbon release scenario. If multiple episodes of CO2 release account for Early Triassic carbon cycle instability (regardless of their precise trigger), then cessation of CO2 release is likely to explain acceleration of biotic recovery early in the Middle Triassic.

abstract = {Most of the organic matter found in the sea is degraded in the seabed. A number of different bacteria are responsible for organic matter degradation. Through their metabolic processes bacteria form inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds that are thus made available for new production. They also produce a number of waste products, such as hydrogen sulphide, that have a great impact on the marine environment. After many years of research, our knowledge of the processes going on in the seabed is substantial. This knowledge forms the basis of a new mathematical model linking the complex material cycles taking place in the seabed and describing the exchange of oxygen and nutrients between seabed and seawater. The construc- tion of the model is described in this report. This report was prepared as a contribu- tion towards developing NERI's expertise within the field of mathematical model- ling.},

abstract = {Two geophysical onshore-offshore lines on the southern margin of Africa form the Agulhas-Karoo Geophysical Transect (AKGT) and cross prominent geological features such as the Karoo Basin, Cape Fold Belt (CFB) and the Beattie Magnetic Anomaly (BMA). Geophysical data acquired along this AKGTransect between 2004 and 2007 within the Inkaba yeAfrica (IyA) framework, provide the platform for constructing a deep crustal section (IyA-200501) for the centre 100 km of the western AKGT-transect in order to resolve these features at depth. We present a detailed deep crustal model constructed from the joint interpretation of: i. archive data comprising surface geology, aeromagnetic data, nearby deep boreholes, teleseismic receiver functions and regional seismic reflection profiles, and ii. line coincident newly acquired high-resolution geophysical data consisting of near vertical seismic reflection data, shallow P- and S-wave velocity data, wide-angle refraction data, high resolution magnetotelluric data and impedance spectroscopy measurements on borehole samples. Our model differentiates four components in the up to 45 km thick crust: 1. a ∼2 to 5 km thick folded Karoo Supergroup, disrupted by low-angle thrust faults rooted in a zone of local decollements in the lower Ecca Group and resting paraconformably on 2. a continuous undeformed sub-horizontal ∼1.5 to 10 km thick wedge of the Cape Supergroup (CSG). This CSG wedge stretches from the Escarpment in the north to the tectonic front of the CFB in the south, and rests on an unconformity that dips about three degrees to the south. The angular unconformity is interpreted as an erosional peneplain that separates the CSG wedge from component 3. the ∼13 to 21 km mid-crust basement below. The mid-crust contains a distinct north-dipping seismic fabric, here interpreted as ∼1.4 to 1.0 Ga Mesoproterozoic Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Belt (NNMB) crust. A south-dipping mid-crustal detachment, interpreted as a ductile thrust zone, separates the mid-crust from component 4. a highly reflective ∼10 to 24 km thick lower crust. The latter is interpreted as an older Palaeoproterozoic section of the NNMB (or even Archean cratonic basement), and bounded by a ∼2 to 5 km thick, highly reflective bottom layer below that lies subparallel to a clear Moho. This bottom layer is interpreted as a mafic underplate, metasomatic reaction zone, or lower-crust to mantle transition zone. Collectively the seismic reflection and wide-angle refraction data support an interpretation that the NNMB mid-crustal layer contains the BMA source, possibly connected to two zones of strong reflectivity: a ∼10 to 12 km wide northern zone and a ∼5 to 7 km wide southern zone, both about 5 km thick and 7 to 8 km below surface. We interpret the BMA source to be at least in part, a Namaqua-like massive to disseminated, deformed/metamorphosed stratiform sulphide-magnetite ore body with metasomatic overprint The seismic reflection and -refraction data support an interpretation that a Pan-African suture zone at the BMA is absent and that instead, the NNMB continues below the CFB tectonic front, probably up to the continental margin and the Agulhas Fracture Zone. The seismic reflection data also supports a thin-skinned tectonic thrust model for the evolution of the CFB without significant fore-deep stratigraphic thickening of the Karoo Basin strata. A compatible tectonic model implies a Palaeozoic collision orogen setting, coupled to a south verging subduction zone much farther south of the CFB. Similarly, the geophysical data support a south dipping subduction zone during the amalgamation of the NNMB in the Mesoproterozoic. Current reconstructions of the Rodinia supercontinent link the NNMB and the Grenville Province of North America across the Grenville-Kibaran orogen. Our seismic section tests this reconstruction through a direct comparison with seismic profiles on the opposite flank of the orogen. Although the once adjacent continental blocks are now 1000s of kilometres apart, the seismic images show a good correlation and support the reconstruction. {\textcopyright} 2011 December Geological Society of South Africa.},

abstract = {Large impacts are credited with the most devastating mass extinctions in Earth's history and the Cretaceous – Tertiary (K/T) boundary impact is the strongest and sole direct support for this view. A review of the five largest Phanerozoic mass extinctions provides no support that impacts with craters up to 180 km in diameter caused significant species extinctions. This includes the 170 km-diameter Chicxulub impact crater regarded as 0.3 million years older than the K/T mass extinction. A second, larger impact event may have been the ultimate cause of this mass extinction, as suggested by a global iridium anomaly at the K/T boundary, but no crater has been found to date. The current crater database suggests that multiple impacts, for example comet showers, were the norm, rather than the exception, during the Late Eocene, K/T transition, latest Triassic and the Devonian – Carboniferous transition, but did not cause significant species extinctions. Whether multiple impacts substantially contributed to greenhouse warming and associated environmental stresses is yet to be demonstrated. From the current database, it must be concluded that no known Phanerozoic impacts, including the Chicxulub impact (but excluding the K/T impact) caused mass extinctions or even significant species extinctions. The K/T mass extinction may have been caused by the coincidence of a very large impact (4250 km) upon a highly stressed biotic environment as a result of volcanism. The consistent association of large magmatic provinces (large igneous provinces and continental flood-basalt provinces) with all but one (end-Ordovician) of the five major Phanerozoic mass extinctions suggests that volcanism played a major role. Faunal and geochemical evidence from the end-Permian, end- Devonian, end-Cretaceous and Triassic/Jurassic transition suggests that the biotic stress was due to a lethal combination of tectonically induced hydrothermal and volcanic processes, leading to eutrophication in the oceans, global warming, sea-level transgression and ocean anoxia. It must be concluded that major magmatic events and their long-term environmental consequences are major contributors, though not the sole causes of mass extinctions. Sudden mass extinctions, such as at the K/T boundary, may require the coincidence of major volcanism and a very large Impact.},

abstract = {Detailed fluorescent microscopic observations and organic geochemical analyses for insoluble sedimentary organic matter (kerogens) are conducted on the end-Permian to earliest Triassic sediments in the Meishan section A of South China. The main objectives of the present study are to reconstruct variations of marine and terrestrial environments, and to evaluate bulk characteristics of terrestrial input in the palaeo-Tethys ocean for the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB). Most of kerogens in the Meishan section are mainly composed of marine algae-derived amorphous organic matter, while terrestrial plant-derived amorphous organic matter is remarkably dominant in the mass extinction horizon reported previously. The relative abundances of marine organic matter may vary depending on marine production rather than terrestrial input in the palaeo-Tethys associated with changing terrestrial vegetation. We also identified aromatic furans as major compounds in kerogen pyrolysate of all layers. It is possible that sources of aromatic furans with alkyl group, fungi and lichen, proliferated as disaster biota in terrestrial ecosystem through the PTB. Higher abundances of herbaceous organic matter are observed in the layers above the mass extinction horizon. However, the conifer biomarker retene can be identified in kerogen pyrolysates of all layers. These results imply that the productions of herbaceous plants increased as dominant pioneer biota in early stage of recovery for terrestrial ecosystem after its collapse, but also that woody plant potentially continued to be produced in land area throughout the end-Permian and earliest-Triassic.},

abstract = {One of the great debates about extinction is whether humans or climatic change caused the demise of the Pleistocene megafauna. Evidence from paleontology, climatology, archaeology, and ecology now supports the idea that humans contributed to extinction on some continents, but human hunting was not solely responsible for the pattern of extinction everywhere. Instead, evidence suggests that the intersection of human impacts with pronounced climatic change drove the precise timing and geography of extinction in the Northern Hemisphere. The story from the Southern Hemisphere is still unfolding. New evidence from Australia supports the view that humans helped cause extinctions there, but the correlation with climate is weak or contested. Firmer chronologies, more realistic ecological models, and regional paleoecological insights still are needed to understand details of the worldwide extinction pattern and the population dynamics of the species involved.},

@article{Boulvain2001,
abstract = {Late Frasnian Petit-Mont Member carbonate mounds occur in the southern part of the Dinant Synclinorium and in the Philippeville Anticline (SW Belgium). These mounds are 30 to 80 m thick and 100 to 250 m in diameter. They are embedded in shale, nodular shale and argillaceous limestone. Based on facies mapping of 14 buildups and related off-mound sediments, these mounds typically started from below the photic and storm wave base zones and builtup into shallow water environments. Above an argillaceous limestone substrate, the first carbonate mound facies consists of spiculitic wackestone with stromatactis (PM1), which becomes progressively enriched in crinoids and corals (PM2), then in peloids, stromatoporoids and cyanobacteria (PM3). PM4 consists of algal–coral–peloid wackestone and packstone with green algae and thick algal coatings. A core of algal and microbial bindstone (PM5) sporadically occurs within large mounds. The uppermost part of these mounds may show a recurrence of facies PM2 and PM1. PM1 to PM3 are coloured red by hematite derived from microaerophilic iron bacteria; PM4 and PM5 are grey. The transition from the aphotic to the cyanobacterial photic zone is recorded in the succession PM2–PM3; the transition from the cyanobacterial to the green algal photic zone is recorded by PM3–PM5. Storm wave base was reached within PM3 and fair-weather wave base within PM5. This paleobathymetric interpretation suggests a depth of 100–150 m during initial establishment of PM1. Three types of mounds can be distinguished on the basis of geometry and facies architecture: (1) “Les Bulants”-type mounds display a continuous vertical facies succession (PM2–3–4–5) and low relief; (2) although exhibiting the same facies succession as “Les Bulants”, “Les Wayons”-type mounds show a distinct relief with steep flanks and bioclastic talus; (3) “St.-R{\'{e}}my” mounds consist exclusively of PM1 and PM2, bioclastic flank deposits are not observed. From (1) to (3), these mound types represent successive deepening down a ramp. Biostratigraphic correlation on a regional scale provides good evidence that relative sea-level changes largely controlled lateral and vertical transitions of facies. Beyond that, hypoxic conditions are indicated by the sponge and iron-bacteria consortium in lower parts of the mounds. This is in agreement with the general assumption of stratified water masses during Late Frasnian, preceding the prominent Lower Kellwasser crisis. Cementation began with a radiaxial synsedimentary cement. A fringe of meteoric phreatic cement, initially nonluminescent, then with a bright orange luminescence, occurs in all mounds. It is contemporaneous with a nonluminescent pervasive cement of grainstones deposited in littoral areas. Differentiation between the (reducing) mounds and the (oxidizing) littoral area resulted from better aquifer circulation in sedimentary bodies close to the recharge area. Late burial cements occlude all the remaining porosity and are contemporaneous with the opening of the Variscan fracture system.},

The carbon dioxide system will be studied by measuring at least two of the controlling parameters; pH, total alkalinity (TA), total inorganic CO2 (TCO2), and the fugacity of CO2 (fCO2). The other parameters can be calculated using thermodynamic relations. In the present paper the thermodynamic equations necessary to characterize the CO2 system in the oceans as a function of salinity and temperature are given. This includes equations for the dissociation of carbonic acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, silicic acid, water, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia in seawater as a function of temperature (0 to 45°C) and salinity (0 to 45).

abstract = {Several commonly used paleoproductivity proxies were compared to evaluate the validity of assumptions and limitations associated with each proxy. Export production fluxes (Cexport) over glacial-interglacial timescales were calculated from previously developed, proxy-specific algorithms at TTN013-pc72 and TTN013-pc114, both located in the equatorial Pacific. Comparison of data from the same core intervals yields conflicting results despite calibrations based on the same core top samples. The periodicity of marine barite, excess Ba, and excess Al-based Cexport records is similar. The relative magnitude of Cexport when calculated using excess Ba and algorithms based on sediment trap data is significantly different than records based on core top calibrations, particularly during glacial intervals. At both sites, bulk sedimentary Al/Ti and Ba/Ti ratios covary; however, these ratios do not correspond with the downcore records of their respective excess concentrations (and their accumulation rates), or with contemporaneous records based on marine barite, excess Ba, and excess Al accumulation. Although downcore records based on sediment mass accumulation rates may be compromised by sediment focusing, this process cannot explain all the differences observed among the various data sets presented here. This implies that some or all of these proxies do not exclusively respond to changes in export production. The contradictions among these data highlight the importance of addressing inconsistencies among paleoproxies and re-examining assumptions imbedded in proxy fundamentals, prior to applying paleoproductivity proxies and interpreting paleoceanographic records.},

abstract = {Reproduction of plants in fragmented habitats may be limited because of lower diversity or abundance of pollinators, and/or variation in local plant density. We assessed natural fruit set and pollinator limitation in ten species of woody plants in natural and restored fragments in the Pondicherry region of southern India, to see whether breeding system of plants (self-compatible and self-incompatible) affected fruit set. We tested whether the number of flowering individuals in the fragments affected the fruit set and further examined the adult and sapling densities of self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species. We measured the natural level of fruit set and pollinator limitation (calculated as the difference in fruit set between hand cross-pollinated and naturally pollinated flowers). Our results demonstrate that there was a higher level of pollinator limitation and hence lower levels of natural fruit set in self-incompatible species as compared to self-compatible species. However, the hand cross-pollinated flowers in SC and SI species produced similar levels of fruit set, further indicating that lower fruit set was due to pollinator limitation and not due to lack of cross-compatible individuals in the fragments. There was no significant relation between number of flowering individuals and the levels of natural fruit set, except for two species Derris ovalifolia, Ixora pavetta. In these species the natural fruit set decreased with increasing population size, again indicating pollinator limitation. The adult and sapling densities in self-compatible species were significantly higher than in self-incompatible species. These findings indicate that the low reproductive output in self-incompatible species may eventually lead to lower population sizes. Restoration of pollinator services along with plant species in fragmented habitats is important for the long-term conservation of biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Chemostratigraphic methods ({\{}delta{\}}13Corg) for pinpointing the Permian-Triassic boundary in nonmarine rocks of Antarctica, Australia, and South Africa have drawn attention to unusual claystone breccias at this horizon of the greatest extinction in the history of life on Earth. These rocks differ from other breccias in having a high proportion of clasts with birefringence microfabrics (sepic plasmic fabrics) characteristic of soils, and can be called sepic pedoliths in the terminology of soil science. At many localities, earliest Triassic sepic pedoliths are thin (5-15 cm) beds, but some fill shallow paleochannels, and pinch out laterally. Other non-marine breccias at the Permian-Triassic boundary are dominated by fragments of coal, pedogenic carbonate nodules, and deeply weathered volcanic rock fragments. Earliest Triassic sepic pedoliths record an unusually severe and widespread episode of soil erosion associated with forest dieback at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Comparable sepic pedoliths are found in debris flows after clear-cutting of forests in western Oregon today. Studies of these modern deposits show that sepic soil peds do not withstand weathering for more than a few months. Such clayey clasts are held together mainly by roots and fungi, which decay rapidly in soils and streams. These modern analogs demonstrate that terminal Permian soil erosion was rapid and profound. Sepic pedoliths are also known at other times of mass extinction, such as the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, but are not yet known before the Devonian advent of trees and forested clayey soils.},

@article{Muramoto1991,
abstract = {In the southern and central Black Sea, reduced sulfur comprises nearly 1{\%} of the total particulate flux in the anoxic water column, as measured by time-series sediment traps. Sulfur isotopic composition of particulate sulfide fluxes indicates an origin near the oxic-anoxic interface, where dissolved sulfide is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulfide below 175 m due to chemical oxidation A strong seasonal correlation exists between sulfur and organic carbon fluxes; this, together with particulate sulfide precipitation at the oxic-anoxic interface, suggests that sulfides are scavenged from the interface during maximum production of settling organic aggregates, particularly during the late summer coccolithophorid blooms. Sulfide precipitation deeper in the water column and in sediments may be limited by availability of iron and/or polysulfides, since there are no particulate sulfide fluxes which have the same isotopic composition as ambient dissolved sulfide at trap depths. Since sulfides in surface sediments are often isotopically similar to dissolved sulfide at the top of the sulfide zone and to sediment trap fluxes, sedimentary sulfides could originate from metal sulfide fluxes forming at the oxic-anoxic interface and would reflect sulfur-cycling processes at the oxic-anoxic interface Sedimentary sulfate reduction rates estimated from assuming 6580{\%} utilization of particulate organic carbon fluxes agree reasonably well with other estimates of sulfate reduction and sulfide production rates. A sulfur isotope-based box model for sulfur cycling between dissolved and particulate phases in the water column and sediments is presented.},

abstract = {Biological activity is a major factor in Earth's chemical cycles, including facilitating CO2 sequestration and providing climate feedbacks. Thus a key question in Earth's evolution is when did life arise and impact hydrosphere–atmosphere–lithosphere chemical cycles? Until now, evidence for the oldest life on Earth focused on debated stable isotopic signatures of 3,800–3,700 million year (Myr)-old metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and minerals from the Isua supracrustal belt (ISB), southwest Greenland. Here we report evidence for ancient life from a newly exposed outcrop of 3,700-Myr-old metacarbonate rocks in the ISB that contain 1–4-cm-high stromatolites—macroscopically layered structures produced by microbial communities. The ISB stromatolites grew in a shallow marine environment, as indicated by seawater-like rare-earth element plus yttrium trace element signatures of the metacarbonates, and by interlayered detrital sedimentary rocks with cross-lamination and storm-wave generated breccias. The ISB stromatolites predate by 220 Myr the previous most convincing and generally accepted multidisciplinary evidence for oldest life remains in the 3,480-Myr-old Dresser Formation of the Pilbara Craton, Australia. The presence of the ISB stromatolites demonstrates the establishment of shallow marine carbonate production with biotic CO2 sequestration by 3,700 million years ago (Ma), near the start of Earth's sedimentary record. A sophistication of life by 3,700 Ma is in accord with genetic molecular clock studies placing life's origin in the Hadean eon ( {\textgreater} 4,000 Ma).},

TEM imaging and EDX analysis indicates the absence of Ca2+ on active Synechococcus sp. and Planktothrix sp. surfaces. Electrophoretic measurements of active cyanobacteria surfaces demonstrate development of a positive surface potential on active Synechococcus sp. and Planktothrix sp. cyanobacteria at pH 8-10. This positive charge was suppressed by the presence of 1 mM HCO3- but enhanced by increasing aqueous Ca2+ concentration in the fluid phase. These observations suggest the existence of a mechanism, based on the metabolic maintenance of a positive surface charge at alkaline pH, protecting active cyanobacteria against Ca2+ adsorption and subsequent carbonate precipitation on their surfaces. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns have been documented. Cyanobacteria have a long evolutionary history, with their first occurrence dating back at least 2.7 billion years ago. Cyanobacteria often dominated the oceans after past mass extinction events. They evolved under anoxic conditions and are well adapted to environmental stress including exposure to UV, high solar radiation and temperatures, scarce and abundant nutrients. These environmental conditions favor the dominance of cyanobacteria in many aquatic habitats, from freshwater to marine ecosystems. A few studies have examined the ecological consequences of global warming on cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton over the past decades in freshwater, estuarine, and marine environments, with varying results. The responses of cyanobacteria to changing environmental patterns associated with global climate change are important subjects for future research.

abstract = {By combining the carbon cycle model with the records of carbonate and organic (kerogen) carbon isotope, this paper presents the calculation of the fraction of organic carbon burial (f org) of beds 23-40 at the global boundary stratotype section and point (GSSP) of the Permian-Triassic boundary at Meishan, Zhejiang Province. The resulting calculation produces two episodes of f org maxima observed to occur at beds 23-24 and 27-29, which respectively corresponds to the two episodic anoxic events indicated by the flourish of green sulfur bacteria. Two episodic forg minima occurred at beds 25-26 and 32-34, generally coincident with the flourish of cyanobacteria (bed 26 and upper part of beds 29 to 34) as shown by the high value of 2-melthyhopnoanes. It appears that the forg is related to the redox conditions, with greater forg values observed under the reductive condition. The relationship between forg and the total organic carbon (TOC) content was complex. The forg value was low at some beds with a high TOC content (such as bed 26), while high observed at some beds with a low TOC content (e.g. bed 27). This association infers the important contribution of primary productivity to the TOC content. The original organic burial could be thus calculated through the configuration of the function of the primary productivity and forg, which can be used to correct the residual TOC measured today. This investigation indicates that compiling the organic-inorganic carbon isotopes with the carbon cycle model favors to understand the fraction of organic carbon burial, providing information for the reconstruction of the coupling among biota, environments and organic burial. {\textcopyright} Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2007.},

A number of ephemeral lakes here contain dolomite, whilst other lakes in close proximity, contain aragonite with minor magnesite.

We here use a combination of oxygen, carbon and sulphur isotopes to help to further constrain the processes leading to dolomite precipitation in modern hypersaline environments. We report isotopic data from four dolomite and three aragonite containing lakes. ??34S data for dissolved lake- and porewater sulphates reveal 34S enrichment of residual sulphate in all seven lakes, consistent with bulk closed system microbial fractionation by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Calculations using temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation factors between dolomite and the solution from which it precipitated are consistent with a strong microbial component to carbonate precipitation in these lakes. A comparison of ??18O data from dolomite and aragonite sediment and from their associated lakewaters indicates seasonal mineral precipitation occurs late in the evaporative cycle of the lakes within a yoghurt-like saturated mud horizon coincident with the zone of sulphate reduction. Surprisingly, ??13C data from the carbonates do not show the characteristic wide range of values often associated with 'organogenic' carbonates, but instead show that these bacterially-mediated precipitates incorporate carbon primarily from the inorganic, lakewater reservoir, partially diluted by an organic component. A 'Coorong type' microbial model of dolomite formation may be particularly applicable to, for example, Precambrian sedimentary dolomites where benthic microbial communities, which are today restricted to extreme environments, dominated the shallow-marine ecosystem prior to the emergence of Metazoa. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study is based on zircon U-Pb ages of 12 volcanic ash layers and volcanogenic sandstones from two marine sections with conformable formational Permian-Triassic boundaries (PTB) in the Nanpanjiang Basin (South China). Our dates of single, thermally annealed and chemically abraded zircons bracket the PTB in Dongpan and Penglaitan and provide the basis for a first proof-of-concept study utilizing a Bayesian chronology model comparing the three sections of Dongpan, Penglaitan and the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) Meishan. Our Bayesian modeling demonstrates that the formational boundaries in Dongpan (251.938{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.029{\&}thinsp;Ma), Penglaitan (251.982{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.031{\&}thinsp;Ma) and Meishan (251.956{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.033{\&}thinsp;Ma) are synchronous within analytical uncertainty of ca. 30{\&}thinsp;ka. It also provides quantitative evidence that the ages of the paleontologically defined boundaries, based on conodont Unitary Associations zones in Meishan and on macrofaunas in Dongpan, are identical and coincide with the age of the formational boundaries. The age model also confirms the extreme condensation around the PTB in Meishan, which distorts the projection of any stratigraphic points or intervals onto other more expanded sections by means of Bayesian age-depth models. Dongpan and Penglaitan possess significantly higher sedimentation rates and thus offer a greater potential for high resolution studies of environmental proxies and correlations around the PTB than Meishan. This study highlights the power of high-resolution radio-isotopic ages that allow a robust intercalibration of patterns of biotic changes and fluctuating environmental proxies and will help recognizing their global, regional or local significance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The mechanisms for uptake of inorganic carbon (Ci) for photosynthesis and calcification of a perforate foraminifer, Amphistegina lobifera Larsen, and an imperforate species Amphisorus hemprichii Ehrenberg, from the Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea were studied in 1986-1987 using 14C tracer techniques. Total Ci uptake of A. lobifera and photosynthetic carbon uptake of A. hemprichii fit the Hill-Whittingham equation that describes the overall rate of enzymatic reactions that are provided with their substrate through a diffusion barrier. This suggests that diffusion is the rate limiting step for total Ci uptake in A. lobifera. Photosynthesis by the isolated symbionts and uptake of CO32- for calcification obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics indicating that enzymatic reactions determine the rate of the separate processes. Both photosynthesis and calcification can be inhibited without affecting each other. Calcification rates in A. lobifera were optimal at Ca levels around normal seawater concentration and were sensitive to inhibitors of respiratory adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and Ca-ATP-ase. This indicates that Ca uptake is also active. Calcification rates of A. hemprichii increased linearly as a function of external Ci concentration over the entire experimental range (0 to 4 mM Ci). In contrast, photosynthetic rates showed Hill-Whittingham type kinetics. The dependence of calcification on the CO32- concentration was also linear, suggesting that its diffusion is the rate limiting step for calcification in A. hemprichii. Increasing Ca concentrations yielded higher calcificatin rates over the entire range measured (0 to 40 mM Ca). Calcification in A. hemprichii was less sensitive to inhibitors of ATP generation than in A. lobivera, suggesting that in A. hemprichii energy supply is less important for this process.},

abstract = {Leg 165 of the Ocean Drilling Program afforded a unique opportunity to investigate organic and inorganic geochemistry across a wide gradient of sediment compositions and corresponding chemical pathways. The solid fractions at Site 998, 999, 1000, and 1001 reveal varying proportions of reactive carbonate species, a labile volcanic ash fraction occurring in discrete layers and as a dispersed component, and detrital fluxes that derive from continental weathering. The relative proportions and reactivities of these end-members strongly dictate the character of the diagenetic profiles observed during the pore-water work of Leg 165. In addition, alteration of the well-characterized basaltic basement at Site 1001 has provided a strong signal that is reflected in many of the dissolved components. The relative effects of basement alteration and diagenesis within the sediment column are discussed in terms of downcore relationships for dissolved calcium and magnesium. With the exception of Site 1002 in the Cariaco Basin, the sediments encountered during Leg 165 were uniformly deficient in organic carbon (typically {\textless}0.1 wt{\%}). Consequently, rates of organic oxidation were generally low and dominated by suboxic pathways with subordinate levels of bacterial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The low rates of organic remineralization are supported by modeled rates of sulfate reduction. Site 1000 provided an exception to the generally low levels of microbially mediated redox cycling. At this site the sediment is slightly more enriched in organic phases, and externally derived thermogenic hydrocarbons appear to aid in driving enhanced levels of redox diagenesis at great depths below the seafloor. The entrapment of these volatiles corresponds with a permeability seal defined by a pronounced Miocene minimum in calcium carbonate concentration recognized throughout the basin and with a dramatic downcore increase in the magnitude of limestone lithification. The latter has been tentatively linked to increases in alkalinity associated with microbial oxidation of organic matter and gaseous hydrocarbons. Recognition and quantification of previously unconstrained large volumes and frequencies of Eocene and Miocene silicic volcanic ash within the Caribbean Basin is one of the major findings of Leg 165. High frequencies of volcanic ash layers manifest as varied but often dominant controls on pore-water chemistry. Sulfur isotope results are presented that speak to secondary metal and sulfur enrichments observed in ash layers sampled during Leg 165. Ultimately, a better mechanistic understanding of these processes and the extent to which they have varied spatially and temporally may bear on the global mass balances for a range of major and minor dissolved components of seawater.},

abstract = {The end-Permian extinction is associated with a mysterious disruption to Earth's carbon cycle. Here we identify causal mechanisms via three observations. First, we show that geochemical signals indicate superexponential growth of the marine inorganic carbon reservoir, coincident with the extinction and consistent with the expansion of a new microbial metabolic pathway. Second, we show that the efficient acetoclastic pathway in Methanosarcina emerged at a time statistically indistinguishable from the extinction. Finally, we show that nickel concentrations in South China sediments increased sharply at the extinction, probably as a consequence of massive Siberian volcanism, enabling a methanogenic expansion by removal of nickel limitation. Collectively, these results are consistent with the instigation of Earth's greatest mass extinction by a specific microbial innovation.},

abstract = {Carcasses of the shrimp Crangon crangon were incubated in a marine medium under oxic conditions at 15??C which was inoculated with a consortium of sulfate-reducing, sulfide-oxidizing, and fermentative bacteria. These standard conditions were varied by adding sediment, omitting sulfate, adding glucose, omitting the inoculum, adding phosphate, and enhancing the buffer capacity. The chemical gradients generated by decay were monitored over a period of 29 days with O2, pH- and sulfide-microelectrodes. In most of the experiments oxygen was depleted, pH decreased and sulfide accumulated around the carcass within a week, creating steep chemical gradients, and decay was predominantly anaerobic. By 29 days maximum change in O2 concentration was from around 200 to 0 ??M, in pH from 7.5 to 6.2 and in sulphide concentration from 0 to 5.6 mM. Although weight loss and general decay were least when only indigenous bacteria were present, only CaCO3 crystal bundles formed and there was no soft tissue preservation. In contrast, where decay and weight loss were more extensive anaerobic sulphate reduction was intense. pH decreased markedly, and some muscle tissue was replicated in CaPO4. The pH close to the decaying carcass seemed to determine whether CaCO3 or CaPO4 formed. Paradoxically, the exceptional preservation of soft-tissues in fossils requires elevated rather than restricted microbial activity as this leads to anaerobically driven authigenic mineral formation.},

abstract = {Recently, a new geochemical temperature proxy, the TEX86, was introduced. This proxy is based on the number of cyclopentane moieties in the glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) of the membrane lipids of marine Crenarchaeota, which changes as a response to temperature. However, until now, only sediment data have been used to establish this proxy, and experimental work is missing. We performed mesocosm studies with marine Crenarchaeota incubated at temperatures ranging from 5 to 35degreesC and salinities of 27 and 35parts per thousand to test the validity of the TEX86 proxy. Growth of marine Crenarchaeota in these mesocosms was evident from the substantial increase in the concentration of marine Crenarchaeotal membrane lipids with amounts up to 3400 ng/L. With increasing temperature, an increase in the number of cyclopentane moieties in the crenarchaeotal membrane lipids was observed. Different salinities did not show any effect on the GDGT distribution. The TEX86 showed a significant linear correlation to incubation temperature: TEX86 = 0.015 x T + 0.10 (r(2) = 0.79). This equation has a similar slope to the correlation obtained from core tops but differs in the intersection (TEX86 = 0.015 x T + 0.28, r(2) = 0.92). This difference is mainly determined by the smaller amount of the regioisomer of crenarchaeol in the incubation series compared to core top samples. These incubation experiments indicates that water temperature is indeed the major controlling factor for the membrane distribution of marine Crenarchaeota and confirms that the TEX86 proxy depends on a physiological response to regulate membrane fluidity.},

abstract = {Paleontological data for the diversity of marine animals and land plants are shown to correlate significantly with a concurrent measure of stable carbon isotope fractionation for approximately the last 400 million years. The correlations can be deduced from the assumption that increasing plant diversity led to increasing chemical weathering of rocks and therefore an increasing flux of carbon from the atmosphere to rocks, and nutrients from the continents to the oceans. The CO(2) concentration dependence of photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation then indicates that the diversification of land plants led to decreasing CO(2) levels, while the diversification of marine animals derived from increasing nutrient availability. Under the explicit assumption that global biodiversity grows with global biomass, the conservation of carbon shows that the long-term fluctuations of CO(2) levels were dominated by complementary changes in the biological and fluid reservoirs of carbon, while the much larger geological reservoir remained relatively constant in size. As a consequence, the paleontological record of biodiversity provides an indirect estimate of the fluctuations of ancient CO(2) levels.},

@article{SepkoskiJr.1984,
abstract = {A three-phase kinetic model with time-specific perturbations is used to describe large-scale patterns in the diversification of Phanerozoic marine families. The basic model assumes that the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern evolutionary faunas each diversified logistically as a consequence of early exponential growth and of later slowing of growth as the ecosystems became filled; it also assumes interaction among the evolutionary faunas such that expansion of the combined diversities of all three faunas above any single fauna's equilibrium caused that fauna's diversity to begin to decline. This basic model adequately describes the diversification of the evolutionary faunas through the Paleozoic Era as well as the asymmetrical rise and fall of background extinction rates through the entire Phanerozoic. Declines in diversity and changes in faunal dominance associated with mass extinctions can be accommodated in the model with short-term accelerations in extinction rates or declines in equilibria. Such accelerations, or perturbations, cause diversity to decline exponentially and then to rebound sigmoidally following release. The amount of decline is dependent on the magnitude and duration of the perturbation, the timing of the perturbation with respect to the diversification of the system, and the system's initial per-taxon rates of diversification and turnover. When applied to the three-phase model, such perturbations describe the changes in diversity and faunal dominance during and after major mass extinctions, the long-term rise in total diversity following the Late Permian and Norian mass extinctions, and the peculiar diversification and then decline of the remnants of the Paleozoic fauna during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras. The good fit of this model to data on Phanerozoic familial diversity suggests that many of the large-scale patterns of diversification seen in the marine fossil record of animal families are simple consequences of nonlinear interrelationships among a small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the evolutionary faunas and are largely (but not completely) invariant through time.

abstract = {Time-dependent variations in the physicochemical properties of pyrite were investigated in four sediment cores from the Black Sea. In the laminated, deep-basin sediments of Unit I and Unit II, {\textgreater}86{\%} of pyrite particles are present as fine-grained framboidal aggregates. In these sediments, the dominance of pyrite framboids, with a narrow size distribution and maximum size {\textless} 18 mum, is evidence of syngenetic (water column) pyrite formation subjacent to the O-2-H2S boundary. Sediments from the basin margin collected below the impingement of the O-2-H2S boundary contain an increased proportion of fine-grained euhedral grains of pyrite relative to framboidal aggregates, suggesting increased additions of diagenetic pyrite below the sediment-water interface. The more efficient reduction and sulfidation of iron in the water column of the central region of the basin implies a more reactive source of iron there compared to the basin margins, and is tied to increasing {\%}pyrite as framboids and greater degrees of pyritization (DOP) in the basin center relative to the basin margins. An evaluation of Fe-S-C relations indicates that pyrite formation was limited by sulfate availability during deposition of the oldest lacustrine sediments of Unit III, C-limited for upper Unit III due to the input of sulfate-rich Mediterranean seawater, and Fe-limited in the laminated, organic carbon-rich sediments of Units I and II. These changes in pyrite-limiting factors occurred within 4 m of compacted burial representing {\textless} 15 ka. Sediment fabric and framboid size distributions at a shallow, basin-margin site suggest that during two extended periods of Unit II deposition, the O-2-H2S transition retreated to depths below 200 m. However, during these same intervals, the delta S-34 Of pyrite remains uniform compared to overlying and underlying laminated sediments, implying that this chemical signature may not be uniquely tied to the position of the O-2-H2S boundary relative to the sediment-water interface, but rather is likely related to biogeochemical processes.

abstract = {The new dataset of the carbon and oxygen stable isotope values across the sedimentary sequence of the Changhsingian Stage at Meishan, south China documents the carbon biogeochemical cycle in detail. The cycle began with storage of organic carbon (Corg), mainly as biogenic carbon dioxide in clathrates, and carbon dioxide from anaeorobic methane oxidation (AMO) in the stratified sea water masses, which is reflected by a rapid increase in the $\delta$13C values. Storage of Corg demanded a large biomass productivity, and thus consumption of a vast amount of carbon dioxide, which would have been associated with climatic oceanic water cooling. Oceanic water cooling and enhanced volcanism is actually reflected by a gradual increase in the $\delta$18O values. The longterm stasis between Corg burial and reburial was then achieved, as reflected by the stable course of the $\delta$13C curve. At the same time, cool water circulation caused a continuous increase in the $\delta$18O values. At the end of the cycle, several factors including earthquakes and other tectonic movements marking the onset of major Siberian volcanism, together with a local temperature increase resulted in a change of ocean circulation, caused mixing of stratified sea water masses. This was followed by destruction of the existing clathrates, degassing of carbon dioxide, oxidation of organic matter, and a rapid decrease in the oceanic $\delta$13C values. Apart from the carbon dioxide that was released to the atmosphere, part of the methane must have been oxidised, creating additional carbon dioxide as well as water vapour. The carbon dioxide and water vapour must have initiated a greenhouse effect and caused thermal stratification of seawater which, in turn, initiated reconstruction of the redox in the Early Triassic. The end of the cycle was associated with the end-Permian mass extinction. The global warming associated with methane release from clathrates led to collapse of terrestrial plants. At the same time, the mixing event brought methane and organic matter for oxidation, which caused massive consumption of oxygen and extinction of the terrestrial fauna. In the marine environment, the mixing event brought water masses rich in carbon dioxide, as well as excess hydrogen ions from anoxic zones, onto shelf areas, causing a collapse of marine biota. The carbon biogeochemical cycle of the Changhsingian indicated by the initial rapid rise, long-term stasis, and final rapid drop in $\delta$13C values, seems to be a rule for a pattern of Phanerozoic $\delta$13C values in sedimentary carbonates. This suggests that a process of methane storage and release may have had a bearing on major geochemical perturbations throughout Earth history. However, methane storage, with or without the association of carbon dioxide and other forms of Corg, and its subsequent release, could have occurred in many different scenarios throughout the Phanerozoic, Therefore, the end of the carbon cycles may be associated with mass extinction only when release of methane is coupled with other phenomena, which is the case with the end-Permian event.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are known for their rapid production of enormous volumes of magma (up to several million cubic kilometres in less than a million years), for marked thinning of the lithosphere, often ending with a continental break-up, and for their links to global environmental catastrophes. Despite the importance of LIPs, controversy surrounds even the basic idea that they form through melting in the heads of thermal mantle plumes. The Permo-Triassic Siberian Traps--the type example and the largest continental LIP--is located on thick cratonic lithosphere and was synchronous with the largest known mass-extinction event. However, there is no evidence of pre-magmatic uplift or of a large lithospheric stretching, as predicted above a plume head. Moreover, estimates of magmatic CO(2) degassing from the Siberian Traps are considered insufficient to trigger climatic crises, leading to the hypothesis that the release of thermogenic gases from the sediment pile caused the mass extinction. Here we present petrological evidence for a large amount (15 wt{\%}) of dense recycled oceanic crust in the head of the plume and develop a thermomechanical model that predicts no pre-magmatic uplift and requires no lithospheric extension. The model implies extensive plume melting and heterogeneous erosion of the thick cratonic lithosphere over the course of a few hundred thousand years. The model suggests that massive degassing of CO(2) and HCl, mostly from the recycled crust in the plume head, could alone trigger a mass extinction and predicts it happening before the main volcanic phase, in agreement with stratigraphic and geochronological data for the Siberian Traps and other LIPs.},

abstract = {The age and duration of the Emeishan basalts (SW China) remain poorly constrained largely due to the severe thermo-tectonic overprinting of the Ar-Ar system and failure to obtain zircon separates from erupted basalts. In an attempt to solve this problem, geochemical analyses and SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating have been carried out on rare felsic ignimbrite in the uppermost of the Emeishan lava succession, the Xuanwei Formation which immediately overlies the Emeishan basalts and a clay tuff at the Middle-Late Permian boundary at the Chaotian section. Clastic rocks of the lowermost Xuanwei Formation (Group 1) in eastern Emeishan large igneous province (LIP) have a geochemical affinity to the Emeishan felsic volcanic rocks, whereas the overlying sediments (Group 2) are compositionally more akin to mafic components of the Emeishan traps. This is the reverse of volcanic sequence of the central Emeishan LIP where the felsic extrusives sit above predominant mafic rocks. It is likely that the clastic rocks are water-transported sediments resulting from erosion of the volcanic rocks in the center of the Emeishan LIP. This interpretation is further supported by the general agreement between the age of the lowermost Xuanwei Formation (257 ?? 4??Ma; 260 ?? 5??Ma) and that of the silicic ignimbrite (263 ?? 4??Ma) and the clay tuff at the Middle-Late Permian boundary at Chaotian (260 ?? 5??Ma). These ages, interpreted as the termination age of the Emeishan volcanism, are indistinguishable within error from the Middle-Late Permian boundary age (260.4 ?? 0.4??Ma) and the main stage (259-262 ?? 3??Ma) of the Emeishan volcanism inferred from dating of mafic and alkaline intrusions in the Emeishan LIP. All these suggest that the emplacement of the Emeishan volcanism took place over a very short interval. Moreover, the temporal link and geochemical analyses suggest that the Chaotian clay at the Middle-Late Permian boundary was genetically related to the Emeishan silicic volcanism. This, together with the fact at that both the Emeishan basalts and the Chaotian clay rest on the Maokou Formation, leads us to infer that the Emeishan basalt was emplaced at the Middle-Late Permian boundary. In this sense, the Emeishan volcanism can be regarded as a boundary event and its age is presumed at ?????260??Ma. Although more precise dating is required, both stratigraphic correlation and chronologic data presented in this paper lend supports to the notion that the Emeishan volcanism was one of likely causes of the end-Guadalupian mass extinction. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Griesbachian age skeletobiont assemblages are dominated by episkeletozoans, while Spathian ones are dominated by endoskeletozoans. Bivalves were the primary hard substrate for the skeletozoans in all examined strata, most likely because they were the most abundant skeletonized benthic invertebrate. Microconchids are hypothesized to have behaved opportunistically during the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction, and they had a strongly preferred association with Claraia.

Accordingly, scenarios for both extinctions are increasingly convergent and cross-fertilization of ideas has become important. Here, we present a synthesis of extinction scenarios based on a critical assessment of the available palaeontological, sedimentological, geochemical and geophysical evidence. How similar were the extinction events, what gaps exist in our understanding and how can a comparison of the events enhance our understanding of each event individually? Our focus is on the most important proximate kill mechanisms including: climate change and atmospheric pollution; increased soil erosion, weathering and runoff; forest dieback and the spread of pathogens; and ocean temperature changes, anoxia and acidification. There is substantial evidence to suggest that very similar kill mechanisms acted upon late Permian as well as Late Triassic ecosystems, strengthening the hypothesis that the ultimate causes of the mass-extinction events were similar.},

abstract = {Changes in carbon and sulfur cycling over geologic time may have caused considerable modification of atmospheric and oceanic composition and climate. Here we calculate pyrite sulfur (Spy) and organic carbon (Corg) burial rates from recently improved Cenozoic stable isotope records, and from these rates we infer global changes in Corg burial environments. Given predominantly normal shelf-delta organic carbon burial, the global Spy burial flux should be coupled to Corg burial. However, we find that the major early Cenozoic peak in Corg burial coincides with a minimum in Spy burial. Although the calculated magnitude of variations in global pyrite burial flux is sensitive to our assumptions about the concentration of sulfate in paleoseawater, a non-steady-state isotope mass balance model indicates very low Spy burial rates during the Paleocene and a dramatic increase starting near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, dropping off to a fairly constant Cenozoic rate beginning in the middle Eocene. High Corg/Spy burial ratios (C/S mole ratio ?15–30) coinciding with the Paleocene carbon isotope maximum most likely reflect enhanced accumulation of terrestrial organic carbon in Paleocene terrestrial swamps. We suggest that rapid burning of accumulated Paleocene terrestrial organic carbon could have significantly contributed to the short-lived negative carbon isotope excursion at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary in addition to or possibly even as an alternative to release of gas hydrates from the continental slopes. An early Eocene minimum in calculated Corg/Spy burial ratios (C/S mole ratio ?2–4) suggests that the predominant locus of organic carbon burial shifted to euxinic environments in a warm early Eocene ocean},

These minicolumnar and sometimes branched stromatolites are produced artificially by the aggregation of a synthetic colloid in a turbulent flow regime. They self-organize at the relatively low particle concentrations found in the outer parts of a spray beam. This contrasts with adjacent stratiform deposits that are produced by high rates of colloid deposition and relatively low sediment viscosities found in the centre of a spray beam. These stratiform laminae become subsequently wrinkled during hardening of the colloid. These results support numerical models that together suggest that physicochemical processes are capable of generating laminated sedimentary structures without the direct participation of biology. Geological environments where comparable abiogenic stromatolites and wrinkle structures may be found include: splash-zone silica sinters, desert varnish crusts and early Archean cherts formed from silica gel precursors.},

abstract = {Biogenic components (brachiopods, crinoids, and corals) in Middle Devonian limestones were manually separated from their enclosing matrix and analyzed by textural, elemental, and isotopic methods in order to assess the preservational state of these components. In general, brachiopods in these rocks are better preserved texturally than other constituents, as determined by SEM and cathodoluminescence observations. Elemental variations among the major components are compatible with a differential response to diagenesis governed by the relative stability of the original mineralogy of the component. However, among the most stable, low-Mg calcite brachiopods, the relationship between textural preservation and trace element content is complex. This apparent complexity may be due at least partially to our method of textural characterization of whole brachipod samples. The nonluminescent portions of a set of well-preserved brachipods have textural characteristics and elemental contents which are virtually indistinguishable from modern representatives. Consequently, their delta 18 O values (-3.7 + or - 0.2 per thousand ) are assumed to represent primary biogenic calcite. These delta 18 O values are in the heavy end of the range of values from texturally well-preserved whole brachiopods (-6.6 to -2.5 per thousand ), texturally altered whole brachiopods (-6.7 to -3.7 per thousand ), and texturally altered crinoids and corals (-6.7 to -2.7 per thousand ). This comparison suggests that marine-derived pore waters were a predominant component during the principal phase of diagenesis. The relatively low delta l8 O values of well-preserved brachiopods compared with modern representatives implies that Middle Devonian seawater was either warmer (by about 10 degrees C) or depleted in 18 O (by about 2-3 per thousand ) relative to modern seawater.},

abstract = {The biological extinction that occurred at the Permian-Triassic boundary represents the most extensive loss of species of any known event of the past 550 million years. There have been a wide variety of explanations offered for this extinction. In the present paper, a number of the more popular recent hypotheses are evaluated in terms of predictions that they make, or that they imply, concerning the global carbon cycle. For this purpose, a mass balance model is used that calculates atmospheric CO2 and oceanic delta13C as a function of time. Hypotheses considered include: (i) the release of massive amounts of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere resulting in mass poisoning; (ii) the release of large amounts of CO2 from volcanic degassing; (iii) the release of methane stored in methane hydrates; (iv) the decomposition and oxidation of dead organisms to CO2 after sudden mass mortality; and (v) the long-term reorganization of the global carbon cycle. The modeling indicates that measured short-term changes in delta13C at the boundary are best explained by methane release with mass mortality and volcanic degassing contributing in secondary roles. None of the processes result in excessively high levels of atmospheric CO2 if they occurred on time scales of more than about 1,000 years. The idea of poisoning by high levels of atmospheric CO2 depends on the absence of subthermocline calcium carbonate deposition during the latest Permian. The most far-reaching effect was found to be reorganization of the carbon cycle with major sedimentary burial of organic matter shifting from the land to the sea, resulting in less burial overall, decreased atmospheric O2, and higher atmospheric CO2 for the entire Triassic Period.},

Here, we show that the end-Permian mass extinction coincided with a rapid temperature rise to exceptionally high values in the Early Triassic that were inimical to life in equatorial latitudes and suppressed ecosystem recovery. This was manifested in the loss of calcareous algae, the near-absence of fish in equatorial Tethys, and the dominance of small taxa of invertebrates during the thermal maxima. High temperatures drove most Early Triassic plants and animals out of equatorial terrestrial ecosystems and probably were a major cause of the end-Smithian crisis.},

We have constrained the environment of their formation from the standpoint of depositional and diagenetic conditions inferred on the basis of petrographic and geochemical data derived from examples in the Helena Formation, a calcareous marine interval within the Mesoproterozoic Belt Supergroup. The collective data set supports an early-diagenetic origin for molar-tooth structures and implies environmental factors that promoted rapid precipitation of calcite into CO2-generated voids in cohesive muds. We propose that the temporally restricted distribution of molar-tooth structures in the geologic record reflects a unique combination of the environmental parameters that control their formation. Of these factors, the most fundamental include CaCO3 saturation and redox conditions in shallow marine waters that promote prolific carbonate production, tectonic quiescence and the availability of extensive epicratonic sites for carbonate accumulation, and the absence of bioturbators.},

abstract = {High-resolution oxygen isotope records document the timing and magnitude of global warming across the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary. Oxygen isotope ratios measured on phosphate-bound oxygen in conodont apatite from the Meishan and Shangsi sections (South China) decrease by 2‰ in the latest Permian, translating into low-latitude surface water warming of 8 °C. The oxygen isotope shift coincides with the negative shift in carbon isotope ratios of carbonates, suggesting that the addition of isotopically light carbon to the ocean-atmosphere system by Siberian Traps volcanism and related processes resulted in higher greenhouse gas levels and global warming. The major temperature rise started immediately before the main extinction phase, with maximum and harmful temperatures documented in the latest Permian (Meishan: bed 27). The coincidence of climate warming and the main pulse of extinction suggest that global warming was one of the causes of the collapse of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, very warm climate conditions in the Early Triassic may have played a major role in the delayed recovery in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic crisis.},

abstract = {The Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen famously distinguished between proximal and ultimate explanations in biology. Proximally, biologists seek a mechanistic understanding of how organisms function; most of this volume addresses the molecular and physiological bases of biomineralization. But while much of biology might be viewed as a particularly interesting form of chemistry, it is more than that. Biology is chemistry with a history, requiring that proximal explanations be grounded in ultimate, or evolutionary, understanding. The physiological pathways by which organisms precipitate skeletal minerals and the forms and functions of the skeletons they fashion have been shaped by natural selection through geologic time, and all have constrained continuing evolution in skeleton-forming clades. In this chapter, I outline some major patterns of skeletal evolution inferred from phylogeny and fossils (Figure 1⇓), highlighting ways that our improving mechanistic knowledge of biomineralization can help us to understand this evolutionary record (see Leadbetter and Riding 1986; Lowenstam and Weiner 1989; Carter 1990; and Simkiss and Wilbur 1989 for earlier reviews). Figure 1. A geologic time scale for the past 1000 million years, showing the principal time divisions used in Earth science and the timing of major evolutionary events discussed in this chapter. Earlier intervals of time—the Mesoproterozoic (1600–1000 million years ago) and Paleoproterozoic (2500–1600 million years ago) eras of the Proterozoic Eon and the Archean Eon ({\textgreater} 2500 million years ago)—are not shown. Time scale after Remane (2000). My discussion proceeds from two simple observations: Skeletal biomineralization requires energy and so imposes a metabolic cost on skeleton-forming organisms. Mineralized skeletons have evolved in many clades of protists, plants and animals. If both statements are true, then clearly for many but not all eukaryotic organisms the biological benefits of biomineralization must outweigh its costs. But cost-benefit ratio is not static. It will change through {\ldots}},

The mudstones were generally formed as lensoidal-shaped layers or infill materials within nodular platform limestones (hardground). Normal marine fauna is diminished in the pyritized limestones, whereas tube-like microorganisms are apparently increased with the association of pyrite crystals consisting of both framboidal and cubic crystals. The total rock volumes are up to 50-60{\%} clay minerals and are mainly made up of in-situ kaolinite and subordinate mixed layer clays (illite-vermiculite). Kaolinite preferentially developed on feldspar crystals, sometimes covering ostracoda bivalves together with gypsum micronodules composed of fan-shaped gypsum crystals. The origin of the kaolinite is, in-situ, directly related to feldspar dissolution via heterotrophic bacteria. Thus, kaolinite is found along with bacterial structures. Other mineralogical compositions include established quartz (mostly {\ss}-quartz), gypsum crystals (100-200 $\mu$m) glauconite and magnetite. Magnetite grains comprise a minor amount (1-2{\%}) and show some bacterial-induced crystal orientations. Glauconite is formed as an accessory mineral that occurs as infill material in biogenic grains. On the other hand, some microspheres represented by a silica-dominated composition are only observed in scanning electron microscopes (SEM) studies under high magnification. Isotope values ($\delta$34S) obtained from the pyritized mudstones show an isotopic heterogeneity that suggests that the pyritized mudstone consists of at least two components, with different sulphur-concentrations and $\delta$34S values.},

abstract = {A study of latest Permian and Early Triassic multielement conodonts identifies eight steps in their evolutionary history during an interval when Earth's biosphere was highly stressed. These steps are: 1) gradual decline of families and genera through the Changhsingian (up to the late Griesbachian); 2) conodont biofacies change and extinction of Tethyan endemic species close to the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB); 3) faunal turnover with extinction and origination in the late Griesbachian; 4) initial radiation in gondolellids and diversification in apparatuses during the Dienerian; 5) explosive radiation in the early-middle Smithian; 6) major extinction in the late Smithian; 7) major radiation early in the Spathian; 8) gradual turnover and decline in the late Spathian through early Anisian. Conodontophorids were reduced from five families at the beginning of the Changhsingian to three by the PTB, and to two late in the Griesbachian. From the Changhsingian to the late Griesbachian, there was a single multielement apparatus represented in the Gondolellidae, whereas by the Olenekian there were at least twelve. Given absolute age constraints, the conodont recovery in the aftermath of the PTB was extraordinary. Conodont evolution during the Dienerian remains obscure but was very significant in terms of changes in multielement apparatuses. In spite of Induan extinctions, generic diversity generally increased from the PTB up to the late Smithian. In terms of species, genera, and multielement apparatuses, the acme of Triassic conodonts was in the middle Smithian, and the biggest extinction was in the late Smithian. After this extinction, generic and apparatus diversity quickly returned to high levels, marking a significant Spathian recovery. Gradual decline characterized the late Spathian and persisted into the early Anisian. A synthetic summary of the temporal distribution and proposed relationships amongst all known Lower Triassic conodonts provide an improved foundation for biostratigraphic and biochronologic studies. Extinction and radiation trends correlate well with sea-level changes and sequence boundaries: faunal turnovers correspond to lowstands in the late Griesbachian, late Smithian, and late Spathian, and radiations correspond to transgressions in the early Griesbachian, early Smithian, and early Spathian. The trends also correlate with perturbations in the carbon cycle, with Lower Triassic [delta]13C minima corresponding to extinction and faunal turnover, and positive values generally occurring during radiations. However, Middle Triassic recovery of marine benthos follows a positive maxima and an overall decline in conodont diversity. New taxa Borinella chowadensis, B. megacuspa, Neogondolella griesbachensis, and N. mongeri are described.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Based on seven measured sections from Svalbard, the marine strata of the Permian Kapp Starostin Formation are arranged into seven transgressive–regressive sequences (TR1–TR7) of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}c{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} . 4–5 Ma average duration, each bound by a maximum regressive surface. Facies, including heterozoan-dominated limestones, spiculitic cherts, sandstones, siltstones and shales, record deposition within inner, middle and outer shelf areas. The lowermost sequence, TR1, comprises most of the basal V{\o}ringen Member, which records a transgression across the Gipshuken Formation following a hiatus of unknown duration. Temperate to cold, storm-dominated facies established in inner to middle shelf areas between the latest Artinskian and Kungurian. Prolonged deepening during sequences TR2 and TR3 was succeeded by a long-term shallowing-upward trend that lasted until the latest Permian (TR4–TR7). A major depocentre existed in central and western Spitsbergen while to the north, Dickson Land remained a shallow platform, leading to a shallow homoclinal ramp in NE Spitsbergen and Nordaustlandet. The Middle Permian extinction (late Capitanian) is recorded near the base of TR6 in deeper parts of the basin only; elsewhere this sequence is not recorded. Likewise the youngest sequence, TR7, extending to the upper formational contact of latest Permian age, is found only in the basin depocentre. Comparison with age-equivalent strata in the Sverdrup Basin of Canada reveals a remarkably similar depositional history, with, for example, two (third-order) sea-level cycles recorded in the Late Permian of both regions, in keeping with the global record. Sequence stratigraphy may therefore be a powerful correlative tool for onshore and offshore Permian deposits across NW Pangaea. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This study examines the morphological responses of Late Permian brachiopods to environmental changes. Quantitative analysis of body size data from Permian-Triassic brachiopods has demonstrated significant, directional changes in body size before, during and after the Late Permian mass extinction event. Brachiopod size significantly reduced before and during the extinction interval, increased for a short time in more extinction-resistant taxa in the latter stages of extinction and then dramatically reduced again across the Permian/Triassic boundary. Relative abundances of trace elements and acritarchs demonstrate that the body size reductions which happened before, during and after extinction were driven by primary productivity collapse, whereas declining oxygen levels had less effect. An episode of size increase in two of the more extinction-resistant brachiopod species is unrelated to environmental change and possibly was the result of reduced interspecific competition for resources following the extinction of competitors. Based on the results of this study, predictions can be made for the possible responses of modern benthos to present-day environmental changes.},

abstract = {Multiple observations have revealed that environmental disturbances may have been linked to the end-Permian extinction and delayed biotic recovery. Biogeochemical constraints on the temporal and spatial changes of mass oceanic redox chemistry during the Permian-Triassic interval are essential to evaluate global significance of previous hypotheses and to improve our understanding of extinction and recovery processes. To investigate redox ocean chemistry change associated with the end-Permian extinction and subsequent delayed biotic recovery, we examine framboidal pyrites as well as sulfur isotopic compositions of pyrites from the East Greenland Basin. The size distributions of framboidal pyrites in sediments from a continuous section across the Permian-Triassic boundary reveal that sulfidic conditions in water columns were established about 0.7 m above the extinction event in the East Greenland Basin. Our detailed examination of framboidal pyrites challenges a leading hypothesis that euxinia in the photic zone caused the end-Permian ecosystem collapse. We identify several positive and negative S-isotopic shifts before and after the extinction event and demonstrate that a positive S-isotopic shift is not indicative of an abrupt change of redox chemistry in water columns, in contrast to previouos claims. The integration of isotope and framboidal pyrite data provides a nearly continuous record of ocean chemistry evolution and new insights into the end-Permian extinction and delayed biotic recovery in the East Greenland Basin.

abstract = {Johnson et al. (1997-this issue) provide a detailed data set on dissolved Fe and compare their data with those from four other laboratories which show simi- lar deep ocean profiles. From these data sets, they hypothesize that dissolved Fe concentrations in deep ocean waters are controlled primarily by organic complexation although dissolved Fe in deep waters is weakly correlated with aeolian deposition. There is no correlation with surface dissolved Fe and aeolian deposition. From their analysis of these data sets, they indicate several major areas for future research. (1) There is a need for interlaboratory compar- isons so that we can assess high Fe values in other environments not included in these data sets. (2) There are few time series measurements. (3) There are no detailed transects of Fe across coastal boundaries. (4) There are no measurements of Fe in many areas of the ocean; these need to be correlated with aeolian flux measurements. (5) There is a need to understand the role of particulate Fe as a source of bioavailable Fe; photo- chemical processes may be crucial in mobilizing Fe. (6) There is a need to understand the physical chemistry of Fe solubility from both inorganic and organic processes at oceanic Fe concentrations. In this discussion, we address several of these areas as we reexamine our previous data using simi- lar data reduction approaches as Johnson et al. (1997-this issue). We applaud Johnson et al. (1997- this issue) for coupling their data set with the data sets of others and stimulating discussion with their interpretations. In addition, Wu and Luther (1996) recently published four detailed transects of dis- solved surface Fe for four different seasons across the Mid Atlantic Bight; we compare this data and that of Wu and Luther (1994, 1995) with that pro- vided in Johnson et al.

abstract = {Zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) are important biologically active trace-metals in the ocean. To date, the marine distributions of these elements have been understood primarily in terms of biological assimilation by growing phytoplankton and regeneration of sinking biological material. Initial studies of Zn and Cd concentrations and stable isotope ratios (??66Zn and ??114Cd) have therefore focused on their use as simple tracers of assimilation and regeneration in the oceans. However, these two processes are insufficient to explain new data on the marine distribution of Zn and ??66Zn. Here, using the first high-resolution paired marine depth profiles of Zn, Cd, ??66Zn and ??114Cd, we suggest that scavenging of Zn onto organic matter plays a major, yet largely unconsidered, role in the marine cycling of Zn. This hypothesis is supported by culture experiments, which show that Zn released from degrading phytoplankton is rapidly scavenged back onto organic matter, and that adsorbed Zn is isotopically heavier than the dissolved phase by 0.58???. In contrast, very little Cd or phosphate was scavenged and Cd isotopes were not significantly fractionated during degradation. Our hypothesis is further supported by one-dimensional modeling, which reproduces observed marine ??66Zn profiles with {\textless}1{\%} of Zn adsorbed to particles. Understanding how Zn cycling in the oceans is a balance between assimilation, scavenging, and regeneration is necessary in order to investigate ??66Zn as a tracer of marine productivity. We anticipate that paired analyses of ??66Zn and ??114Cd will prove to be valuable new tools in constraining patterns of global primary productivity, providing key information for the marine carbon cycle during periods of past and present global climate change. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Permian-Triassic boundary microbialites (PTBMs) are thin (0.05-15 m) carbonates formed after the end-Permian mass extinction. They comprise Renalcis-group calcimicrobes, microbially mediated micrite, presumed inorganic micrite, calcite cement (some may be microbially influenced) and shelly faunas. PTBMs are abundant in low-latitude shallow-marine carbonate shelves in central Tethyan continents but are rare in higher latitudes, likely inhibited by clastic supply on Pangaea margins. PTBMs occupied broadly similar environments to Late Permian reefs in Tethys, but extended into deeper waters. Late Permian reefs are also rich in microbes (and cements), so post-extinction seawater carbonate saturation was likely similar to the Late Permian. However, PTBMs lack widespread abundant inorganic carbonate cement fans, so a previous interpretation that anoxic bicarbonate-rich water upwelled to rapidly increase carbonate saturation of shallow seawater, post-extinction, is problematic. Preliminary pyrite framboid evidence shows anoxia in PTBM facies, but interbedded shelly faunas indicate oxygenated water, perhaps there was short-term pulsing of normally saturated anoxic water from the oxygen-minimum zone to surface waters. In Tethys, PTBMs show geographic variations: (i) in south China, PTBMs are mostly thrombolites in open shelf settings, largely recrystallised, with remnant structure of Renalcis-group calcimicrobes; (ii) in south Turkey, in shallow waters, stromatolites and thrombolites, lacking calcimicrobes, are interbedded, likely depth-controlled; and (iii) in the Middle East, especially Iran, stromatolites and thrombolites (calcimicrobes uncommon) occur in different sites on open shelves, where controls are unclear. Thus, PTBMs were under more complex control than previously portrayed, with local facies control playing a significant role in their structure and composition.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analyses of carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb) and total organic carbon (TOC; $\delta$13Corg), together with geochemical analyses of 54 major, minor, and trace elements and magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on whole rock samples of the undisturbed Permian–Triassic (P/Tr) limestone boundary sequence in the Idrijca Valley (W. Slovenia). At the P/Tr boundary, there is a 0.8-cm thick clayey marl layer (PTB) showing a characteristic magnetic susceptibility pulse and considerable enrichment in most major, minor, and trace elements. The P/Tr transition is characterized by (1) an abrupt decrease in sedimentation rate from 32 to 5 cm/100 ka, (2) a well known prominent negative excursion of $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg, reflecting global perturbations in the carbon cycle, and (3) the drastic disappearance of typically Upper Permian marine fauna. Although the shape of the $\delta$13Ccarb curve indicates gradual long-term change across the P/Tr boundary, the sharp negative $\delta$13Corg anomaly within an interval from 30 cm below to 6 cm above the boundary suggests an interruption of those gradual processes. Our observations for selected redox sensitive elements (Mo, U, V and Zn), abundances for organic carbon and sulphur and the rare earth elements (REE) distribution in the boundary sequence, as well as the shape of the Ce/Ce* curve suggest that oceanic anoxia was typical of the Upper Permian, and that the transition to oxygenated conditions occurred at the P/Tr boundary. Oxygenation at the P/Tr transition is coincidental with the terminal phase of the Upper Permian marine regression. The shape of the Ce/Ce* curve indicates that the redox environmental conditions changed again in the earliest Triassic, resulting once more in oxygen deficient conditions.},

abstract = {Relationships between organic carbon, total nitrogen and organic nitrogen concentrations and variations in $\delta$13Corg and $\delta$15Norg are examined in surface sediments from the eastern central Arctic Ocean and the Yermak Plateau. Removing the organic matter from samples with KOBr/KOH and determining residual as well as total N shows that there is a significant amount of bound inorganic N in the samples, which causes TOC/Ntotal ratios to be low (4–10 depending on the organic content). TOC/Norg ratios are significantly higher (8–16). This correction of organic TOC/N ratios for the presence of soil-derived bound ammonium is especially important in samples with high illite concentrations, the clay mineral mainly responsible for ammonium adsorption. The isotopic composition of the organic N fraction was estimated by determining the isotopic composition of the total and inorganic nitrogen fractions and assuming mass-balance. A strong correlation between $\delta$15Norg values of the sediments and the nitrate concentration of surface waters indicates different relative nitrate utilization rates of the phytoplankton in various regions of the Arctic Ocean. On the Yermak Plateau, low $\delta$15Norg values correspond to high nitrate concentrations, whereas in the central Arctic Ocean high $\delta$15Norg values are found beneath low nitrate waters. Sediment $\delta$13Corg values are close to −23.0‰ in the Yermak Plateau region and approximately −21.4‰ in the central Arctic Ocean. Particulate organic matter collected from meltwater ponds and ice-cores are relatively enriched in 13C ($\delta$13Corg=−15.3 to −20.6‰) most likely due to low CO2(aq) concentrations in these environments. A maximum terrestrial contribution of 30{\%} of the organic matter to sediments in the central Arctic Ocean is derived, based on the carbon isotope data and various assumptions about the isotopic composition of the potential endmembers.},

abstract = {The isotopic composition of sulphur has been determined for a large number of specimens representing the important geochemical phases in which sulphur is present. The most significant process that causes sulphur isotopic fractionation is the reduction of dissolved sulphate by bacteria, although other processes such as distillation of volcanic emanations, oxidation-reduction of H2S, SO2 and S during volcanism and sulphide-sulphate equilibrium under magmatie or hydrothermal conditions can be locally important. The new data are combined with earlier work in an attempt to define the range and average S32/S34 ratio of the various sulphur-bearing phases of the crust. The most important averages are meteorites 22.21, ocean sulphate 21.76, mafic rocks 22.16, plutonic silicic rocks 22.13, hydrothermal sulphides 22.13 and sedimentary sulphide 22.49 and post-Cambrian evaporite sulphate 21.80. A material balance calculation of the sulphur isotopes in the crust, although subject to considerable uncertainties, points to an average crustal composition of sulphur heavier than that for meteorites. No age effect is found for at least the last 2 × 109 years. Finally, a geochemical theory is described to account for the apparent distribution of sulphur isotopes in the lithosphere.},

abstract = {The Late Devonian mass extinction was unusually protracted and ecologically selective, with preferential diversity losses among reef-building organisms and tropical, shallow-water faunas in general. We have investigated the link between the extinction's unique characteristics and changes in biogeochemical cycling through analyses of the delta13C and C:N:P atomic ratios of organic matter buried across the Kellwasser Horizons in western New York State. Each horizon is characterized by (1) a long-term, +4per thousand-5per thousand excursion in delta13C, {\~{}}3per thousand of which occurs within the horizon, and (2) a dramatic increase in the burial ratios of C:N:P, from values of {\~{}}100:15:1 to an average of {\~{}}5000:170:1. On the basis of these results, we propose that (1) increased efficiency of biolimiting nutrient recycling, resulting from cyclic water column stratification and mixing, promoted eutrophication during Kellwasser deposition in New York, and (2) the isotope excursions represent the composite effect of long-term, global organic C burial, and local changes in photosynthetic C isotope fractionation related to nutrient availability. This eutrophication model forges a mechanistic link between proposed Late Devonian climatic cooling and the selective demise of taxa likely to have been narrowly adapted to oligotrophic conditions.},

New delta18O data from the tropical Atlantic show synchronous shifts approximately 91.2 million years ago for both the surface and deep ocean that are consistent with an approximately 200,000-year period of glaciation, with ice sheets of about half the size of the modern Antarctic ice cap.

abstract = {Molecular and carbon isotopic geochemistry of hopanes in marine sediments of the Meishan section in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province of China, were studied to reveal biotic and environmental changes across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) and the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundary (WCB). The hopane distribution at the PTB is characterized by high ratios of moretane/hopane, Tm/Ts, Tm/C30 hopane, C31/C32 hopane and hopane/sterane. This hopane distribution is anomalous for these marine sediments, but it is typical of coal measure strata and soils. Two possible genetic mechanisms for such an anomaly are suggested: (1) these hopanes were terrigenous and most probably originated from acidified soil and peat. This mechanism implies that the marine primary production and aerobic bacteria production at the PTB were extremely low. (2) This hopane distribution was possibly caused by freshening and acidification of the upper water column during the end-Permian to Early Triassic marine stagnation and stratification. This hopane anomaly, which coincides with the end-Permian mass extinction and carbon-isotope excursion, may signal the end-Permian mass extinctions and marine and terrigenous ecosystem collapse. The 13C-enriched hopanes with the fingerprint of typical anoxic marine shales, coupled with an n-C15-n-C17-dominated distribution of n-alkanes, strongly indicate that the organic matter around the WCB at Meishan originated mainly from cyanobacteria. The corresponding positive $\delta$13Ccarbonate, and higher total organic carbon and hydrocarbon index (HI) values, strongly suggest that high marine primary production and marine anoxia caused by intermittent cyanobacterial blooms, resulted in the local mass extinction at Meishan. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Widespread anoxic and dysoxic deposition in marine sediments has been associated with a stagnant ocean at the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary. This P-Tr boundary is also associated with one of the largest mass extinctions of species of the Paleozoic, marking the transition to the Mesozoic. Here we review recent three-dimensional numerical model studies that have investigated possible circulation patterns at the P-Tr boundary. In addition, we conduct new sensitivity experiments with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model of intermediate complexity, including marine chemistry, to study changes of the deep-sea oxygen distribution associated with (1) a significant change in the hydrological cycle and (2) a massive release of methane gas hydrates from marine sediments. Freshening of sea surface water masses by a strong freshwater source along the west coast of south polar Pangea produces a significant local minimum in oxygen in the eastern tropical Panthalassa ocean at intermediate depth and at the sea floor. The methane release experiment with an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 18 times the preindustrial CO2 level simulates a strong increase in sea surface temperature (about 4.5??C) and a vigorous deep-sea circulation. In contrast to the conclusions drawn from previous studies, this reanalysis of the ocean circulation at the P-Tr boundary favors a strong ventilation in most parts of the deep-sea. Thus, a significant change in the oceanic carbon inventories and a reorganization of the marine productivity associated with a stronger biological pump may be required to explain the anoxic sedimentary deposits. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A petrographic and biosedimentological study of the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese from the Trento Plateau (north-eastern Italy) shows that diagenetic (neomorphism, recrystallization) and biological processes (microbial content and pigmentation) influenced the formation and alteration of the carbonate matrix. The subject of this article is the interaction of early diagenetic processes and an attempt to explain the different colors of the matrix (red, pink, grey). Nearly 200 samples derived from 14 sections (Callovian to Tithonian) located in the Verona area have been studied by means of classical, cathodoluminescence and SEM microscopy. Calcite and ferruginous microfilaments of different shapes and sizes are present and tentatively attributed to fungi and iron bacteria. These micro-organisms precipitated iron oxy-hydroxides at poorly dysoxic-anoxic sediment-water interfaces. Further liberation of submicronic hydroxides (now hematite) was responsible for the red pigmentation of the carbonate matrices, originally composed of less than 1 mu m-sized micrite. Controversial smaller nanograins (0.1-0.5 mu m) attributed to nanobacteria or planktonic picoeukaryotes have been observed in the reddish samples. Recrystallization of the micrite leads to the formation of new micritic crystals, between 2 and 4 mu m in size, then to microspar crystals. Micritic textures are linked to the different colours of the samples. The intensity of the red colour is correlated with the presence of hematite (former iron hydroxides) and the presence of planar subhedral micritic grains. In contrast, pink and greyish samples are linked to the increasingly coalescent structure of anhedral micritic and microsparitic crystals.},

abstract = {Marine barite (BaSO4) is produced in the water column in association with decaying organic matter; its distribution in the water column and in core-top sediments closely corresponds with the organic carbon flux from the surface ocean to the deep ocean (export production). Barite preservation in non-sulfate-reducing sediments is high, compared to other proxies used to reconstruct both export carbon fluxes (export production) and carbon burial rates. Thus the accumulation rate of marine barite is one of the most promising methods (or proxy variables) for export production and has been used to understand and reconstruct past biogeochemical processes in the ocean, including export productivity. Like any other paleoceanographic proxy, there are assumptions and complications associated with the application of barite accumulation rates in reconstructing export production. Specifically, because barite constitutes only a small fraction of the total sediment ({\textless}1{\%}), computing precise barite accumulation rates depends on accurate estimates of bulk sediment mass accumulation rates which are hard to determine, particularly at high temporal resolution. Moreover, the significance of variable barite preservation depends on seawater saturation levels with respect to barite and sedimentation rates, which have not yet been fully investigated. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of this proxy, and if used wisely, marine barite accumulation rates in marine sediments can provide valuable information about changes in carbon export to depth and the response of the carbon cycle to climate perturbations in the geological record. Ideally, to achieve higher confidence in paleo-reconstructions of export production, several independent proxies should be applied simultaneously at any given site or time interval. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Down-core trends for extents of iron sulfidation in upper Holocene microlaminated deposits of the Black Sea abyssal plain imply that most of the pyrite in these sediments is formed in the sulfidic water column and/or very close to the sediment-water interface. Sulfur isotopic data for pyrite within microlaminated muds from two localities in the deep basin show striking uniformity between sites and down core, with a mean $\delta$34SCDT value of −37.2 ± 0.9‰ (1$\sigma$, n = 18). These isotopic trends support the hypothesis of early pyrite formation. Isotopic compositions of pyrite sulfur in the microlaminated bottom sediments are similar to those reported for particulate reduced sulfur collected in middepth sediment traps and to$\delta$34S values for water-column dissolved sulfide within a narrow zone immediately below the O2/H2S interface. These three sulfur reservoirs are distinctly different from the isotopic composition of ambient dissolved sulfide of the deep water column ({\textgreater}175 m), with $\delta$34S values for the deep dissolved sulfide reservoir being consistently lower by ∼2 to 4‰. These isotopic relationships suggest that iron sulfidation is occurring dominantly within a narrow, shallow region at the top of the sulfidic water mass. Isotopic data from a fine-grained turbidite collected in the deep basin and from rapidly accumulating, iron monosulfide-rich muds on the anoxic upper slope are enriched in34S relative to the microlaminated deposits. The enrichments on the basin margin reflect a large component of iron sulfide formed during rapid burial. A broad suite of geochemical data, including sulfur isotopic results, are consistent with an upper-slope sediment source for the ubiquitous muddy turbidites of the deep basin. The collective effects of reworking, transport, and redeposition result in a complete conversion of AVS to pyrite with little additional iron sulfidation. This conclusion is supported by a detailed isotopic mass balance. The present isotopic study also highlights fundamental differences in the reactivities of the iron reservoirs distributed throughout the anoxic basin. Sediments of the upper slope and the genetically-linked turbidites of the deep basin show similar extents of iron sulfidation that are significantly lower than those of the microlaminated deposits of the deep-basin floor, suggesting dramatically shorter timescales of iron reactivity for the microlaminated sediments of the deep basin. Importantly, isotopic patterns from the modern Black Sea should assist greatly in the recognition and interpretation of ancient anoxia in the stratigraphic record.},

abstract = {The distribution of barium (Ba) concentrations in seawater resembles that of nutrients and Ba has been widely used as a proxy of paleoproductivity. However, the exact mechanisms controlling the nutrient-like behavior, and thus the fundamentals of Ba chemistry in the ocean, have not been fully resolved. Here we present a set of full water column dissolved Ba (DBa) isotope ($\delta$ 137BaDBa) profiles from the South China Sea and the East China Sea that receives large freshwater inputs from the Changjiang (Yangtze River). We find pronounced and systematic horizontal and depth dependent $\delta$ 137BaDBa gradients. Beyond the river influence characterized by generally light signatures (0.0 to +0.3‰), the $\delta$ 137BaDBa values in the upper water column are significantly higher (+0.9‰) than those in the deep waters (+0.5‰). Moreover, $\delta$ 137BaDBa signatures are essentially constant in the entire upper 100 m, in which dissolved silicon isotopes are fractionated during diatom growth resulting in the heaviest isotopic compositions in the very surface waters. Combined with the decoupling of DBa concentrations and $\delta$ 137BaDBa from the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate this implies that the apparent nutrient-like fractionation of Ba isotopes in seawater is primarily induced by preferential adsorption of the lighter isotopes onto biogenic particles rather than by biological utilization. The subsurface $\delta$ 137BaDBa distribution is dominated by water mass mixing. The application of stable Ba isotopes as a proxy for nutrient cycling should therefore be considered with caution and both biological and physical processes need to be considered. Clearly, however, Ba isotopes show great potential as a new tracer for land-sea interactions and ocean mixing processes.},

abstract = {The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous continental flood basalt provinces on Earth. The mass extinction at the end of the Permian was the most severe in the history of life. In the present paper, these two major concurrent events that occurred are analysed and a geochemical model coupled with an energy balance model is used to calculate their environmental impact on atmospheric CO2, oceanic $\delta$13C, and marine anoxia. The latitudinal temperature gradient is reduced relative to today, resulting in warmer temperatures at high latitudes. The warmer climate and the presence of fresh basaltic provinces increase the weatherability of the continental surfaces, resulting in an enhanced consumption of atmospheric CO2 through weathering. First, the eruption of the Siberian traps is accompanied by a massive volume of 13C depleted CO2 degassed from the mantle and added to the ocean through silicate weathering, thus lowering marine $\delta$13C. Second, the rapid collapse in productivity induces a strong decrease in the global organic carbon burial. This too tends to increase the proportion of light carbon in the ocean. These two effects can explain the low $\delta$13C values across the PT boundary, and methane release need not be invoked to explain the $\delta$13C fluctuations. It is proposed that the phosphorus cycle, which drives primary production in the model, plays an important role on the recovery of productivity and the $\delta$13C variations.},

The framboids are abundant in the thin pyrite lamina on the top of Bed 24e (the upper layer of Bed 24), and Beds 25, 26 and 29, rare in Bed 24e and Bed 28, but absent in Bed 27. They have narrow size distributions with average diameters from 4.6????m to 8.7????m which are similar to those formed under anoxic/dysoxic conditions. The abundances and mean diameters of the pyrite framboids indicate redox conditions of deposition changing from upper dysoxia (Bed 24e) and lower dysoxia (pyrite lamina, Beds 25 and 26) to oxygenation (Bed 27), and again to upper dysoxia (Bed 28) and lower dysoxia (Bed 29). Our discovery confirms a worldwide dysoxic marine event during the Permian-Triassic transition, suggestive of a direct relationship with the Permian-Triassic marine mass extinction. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We measured in situ photosynthesis of benthic microbial mats at various depths in Lake Hoare, a permanently ice-covered lake of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, using oxygen (02) microelectrodes. We further investigated the vertical distribution and activity of pigments in the microbial mats using an imaging pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer. Microbial mats to at least 16.6-m water depth are net producers Of 02 during the summer period. Net 02 production ranges from 100-500 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) at incident downwelling irradiances of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 1.0-4.6 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). Photosynthesis of mat-forming cyanobacteria and diatoms occurs at all lake depths at or close to maximum efficiency. We measured absorption by the pigment arrays at a single water depth and, by assuming that absorption is water-depth invariant, we estimated an area-specific maximum community quantum yield of 0.073 mol carbon per mol photons. A community compensation irradiance of 0.1 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) was estimated, reflecting extreme shade acclimation. These results confirm estimates previously derived from laboratory gas-exchange measurements and imply that even minor changes in the intensity of the incident downwelling irradiance of PAR caused by, for example, changes in the transparency of the ice cover or the optical properties of the water column can significantly alter rates of benthic carbon fixation. In situ measurements were confined to mats with flat surfaces. Laboratory measurements at the surface of mats with pinnacled surfaces revealed a complex small-scale chemical structure at the mat-water interface.},

abstract = {Microbialite masses within the lowest Triassic strata along the southern periphery of the tropical Yangtze Platform were produced in a post-Permian microbial regime. These microbialites (the Hindeodus parpus Zone), which are represented by thrombolites, occur only where terrigenous sediment influx was rare, even in shallow-marine-settings. The lower parts of the thrombolites lie upon a distinctly unconformable Permian-Triassic boundary and exhibit a thin-bedded to thick-bedded planar structure. In contrast, the upper parts of the thrombolites contain domed macrostructures that interact in complex ways with skeletal grainstones and packstones. Irregular frameworks of thrombolite bodies differ in degree of lateral and vertical accumulation and in the amalgamation of mesoclots of microbial origin; they exhibit marked variations in texture. A transgressive episode occurred in the earliest Triassic following the mass extinctions, and this included the initiation of microbial regimes that usually formed planar thrombolite masses in lower-energy, deep subtidal environments. The varied textures and structures of thrombolites during deposition may reflect a combination of sea-level fluctuations, physicochemical ocean conditions, microbial activity, skeletal-sediment influx, and other factors. These earliest Triassic, uniquely microbial regimes collapsed in stepwise fashion and were succeeded by the Isarcicella staeschei and I. isarcica zones, which contain a pre-dominance of mudstones, suggesting a marked sea-level transgression. Space-specific and time-specific, the earliest Triassic microbialites record short-term, high-resolution paleoenvironmental fluctuations immediately after the end-Permian extinctions.

abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) has been attributed to the rapid release of approximately 2000 x 10(9) metric tons of carbon in the form of methane. In theory, oxidation and ocean absorption of this carbon should have lowered deep-sea pH, thereby triggering a rapid ({\textless}10,000-year) shoaling of the calcite compensation depth (CCD), followed by gradual recovery. Here we present geochemical data from five new South Atlantic deep-sea sections that constrain the timing and extent of massive sea-floor carbonate dissolution coincident with the PETM. The sections, from between 2.7 and 4.8 kilometers water depth, are marked by a prominent clay layer, the character of which indicates that the CCD shoaled rapidly ({\textless}10,000 years) by more than 2 kilometers and recovered gradually ({\textgreater}100,000 years). These findings indicate that a large mass of carbon ({\textgreater}{\textgreater}2000 x 10(9) metric tons of carbon) dissolved in the ocean at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and that permanent sequestration of this carbon occurred through silicate weathering feedback.},

abstract = {Concentrations of magnetite were determined, with depth, in sediments of varying H2S content taken from Long Island Sound (FOAM, NWC, and Sachem sites) and from a site in the rapidly depositing subaqueous portion of the Mississippi Delta. For the three Long Island Sound sites, dissolution of magnetite during burial is clearly demonstrated, and for all four sites the rate of magnetite dissolution is proportional to the concentration of dissolved pore water sulfide. By combining magnetite depth distributions with sedimentation rate data and measurements of dissolved sulfide, we find that magnetite dissolution is well described by the following rate law: dCmag dt = -1.1× 10-5C0.5BCmagAmag where Cmag is the concentration of magnetite (grams per gram of sediment), Cs is the concentration of dissolved sulfide (mM), and Amag is the specific surface area of magnetite in the sediment (cm2 per gram of magnetite.) This equation means that, for a typical range of magnetite surface areas and dissolved sulfide concentrations, the "half-life" of magnetite in anoxic marine sediments ranges from about 50 to 1000 years. SEM observations of magnetite grains from the different sediment sites reveal that magnetite dissolution may be accompanied by extensive replacement by pyrite. This only occurs if magnetite is in contact with high concentrations of H2S ({\textgreater}1 mM) for relatively long periods of time (several hundred years). With low concentrations of H2S ({\textless}1 mM) magnetite dissolution occurs without identifiable pyrite replacement. We suggest that this feature of magnetite diagenesis may prove to be a useful paleosulfide indicator. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Earth scientists have had no direct way of calculating longitudes for times before those of the oldest hotspot track eruption sites in the Cretaceous ({\~{}} 130??Myr ago). For earlier times palaeomagnetic data constrain only ancient latitudes and continental rotations. We have recently devised a hybrid plate motion reference frame that permits the calculation of longitude back to Pangean assembly at {\~{}} 320??Ma. This reference frame, here corrected for True Polar Wander (TPW), places most reconstructed Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) of the past 300??Myr radially above the edges of the Large Low Shear wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in Earth's lowermost mantle. This remarkable correlation between surface and deep mantle features, which is also discernible for all hotspots with a deep-plume origin, provides a new way of reconstructing the original positions of LIP sites, and therefore the position of continents whose longitudes have hitherto been unknown. We place the 258??Ma Emeishan LIP eruption of South China at 4??N and 140??E, in that way constraining the width and the geometry of the Palaeotethys Ocean during the Late Permian. If LLSVPs have remained stable for even longer and TPW has been small, we can, under these assumptions, also restore Siberia and Gondwana longitudinally for Late Devonian ({\~{}} 360??Ma) and Late Cambrian ({\~{}} 510??Ma) times. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The uppermost Permian strata of the Abadeh section in Iran consist of 56 m of skeletal limestone (Abadehian), that grades upward into 18 m of grey, bioturbated lime mudstone (Djulfian), which in turn grades upward to 18 m of red, nodular wackestone (Dorashamian) containing an abundant pelagic fauna. The overlying lowermost Triassic includes two enigmatic layers at its base. Immediately above the boundary is a 1-m-thick layer of inorganically precipitated synsedimentary carbonate cement. The cement is composed of 10-20-cm-long crystals oriented either perpendicular to the bedding or as dome-shaped features resembling botryoids. About 0.5 m of wackestone overlies the cement layer. The second layer is a 1.5-m-thick grainstone overlying the cement horizon and consists of recrystallised spherical grains (ooids or peloids). The remainder of unit [`]A' is composed of 100+ m of grey, bioturbated to nodular lime mudstone. The lithofacies succession of the uppermost Permian is interpreted to represent deposition under increasing water depth, related to rising of relative sea level, which led to drowning of the carbonate platform to below storm wave base. Sedimentologic characteristics, lithology, wide distribution, and slow sedimentation rates indicate that strata immediately below the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary (Dorashamian interval) were deposited in deep, oxygenated waters. The enigmatic lowermost Triassic synsedimentary carbonate cement and grainstone layers are interpreted to have been deposited in shallow waters, indicating a rapid and major drop in relative sea level at the end of Permian time in this area, followed by a relative sea-level rise during the earliest Triassic. Precipitation of synsedimentary cement immediately above the P-T boundary in Iran and elsewhere (South China) suggests a global change in ocean chemistry. One possible explanation is that dissolved calcium and bicarbonate concentrations in seawater increased sufficiently to promote spontaneous carbonate precipitation, a rare event in the Phanerozoic but common during Precambrian time. Alternatively, a massive heating event could have resulted in CO2 degassing and decreases in oceanic carbonate solubility, both leading to inorganic, synsedimentary carbonate precipitation. Inorganic precipitation of synsedimentary carbonate cement may indicate that biochemical production of carbonate was halted due to the P-T boundary events. Our study indicates that shallow and moderately deep waters during the latest Permian were well oxygenated in the open ocean setting of the central Tethys Sea in Iran. Therefore, P-T mass extinction scenarios that invoke upon widespread marine anoxia should be viewed with caution.},

We have identified the compound in high relative abundance in 29 samples from P-Tr marine sections from two separate paleogeographic localities, from Laurasia and Gondwana. Relative concentrations of the C33 n-alkylcyclohexane show similar changes to the relative abundances of extinct spinose acritarchs (Veryhachium and Micrhystridium) indicating that the source organism of the C33 n-alkylcyclohexane is associated with the depositional environments/facies in which the acritarchs are identified.

abstract = {Widespread development of microbialites characterizes the substrate and ecological response during the aftermath of two of the 'big five' mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. This study reviews the microbial response recorded by macroscopic microbial structures to these events to examine how extinction mechanism may be linked to the style of microbialite development. Two main styles of response are recognized: (i) the expansion of microbialites into environments not previously occupied during the pre-extinction interval and (ii) increases in microbialite abundance and attainment of ecological dominance within environments occupied prior to the extinction. The Late Devonian biotic crisis contributed toward the decimation of platform margin reef taxa and was followed by increases in microbialite abundance in Famennian and earliest Carboniferous platform interior, margin, and slope settings. The end-Permian event records the suppression of infaunal activity and an elimination of metazoan-dominated reefs. The aftermath of this mass extinction is characterized by the expansion of microbialites into new environments including offshore and nearshore ramp, platform interior, and slope settings. The mass extinctions at the end of the Triassic and Cretaceous have not yet been associated with a macroscopic microbial response, although one has been suggested for the end-Ordovician event. The case for microbialites behaving as 'disaster forms' in the aftermath of mass extinctions accurately describes the response following the Late Devonian and end-Permian events, and this may be because each is marked by the reduction of reef communities in addition to a suppression of bioturbation related to the development of shallow-water anoxia.},

abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; {\~{}}56 Ma) is associated with abrupt climate change, carbon cycle perturbation, ocean acidification, as well as biogeographic shifts in marine and terrestrial biota that were largely reversed as the climatic transient waned. We report a clear exception to the behavior of the PETM as a reversing climatic transient in the eastern North Atlantic (Deep-Sea Drilling Project Site 401, Bay of Biscay) where the PETM initiates a greatly prolonged environmental change compared to other places on Earth where records exist. The observed environmental perturbation extended well past the $\delta$13C recovery phase and up to 650 kyr after the PETM onset according to our extraterrestrial 3He-based age-model. We observe a strong decoupling of planktic foraminiferal $\delta$18O and Mg/Ca values during the PETM $\delta$13C recovery phase, which in combination with results from helium isotopes and clay mineralogy, suggests that the PETM triggered a hydrologic change in western Europe that increased freshwater flux and the delivery of weathering products to the eastern North Atlantic. This state change persisted long after the carbon-cycle perturbation had stopped. We hypothesize that either long-lived continental drainage patterns were altered by enhanced hydrological cycling induced by the PETM, or alternatively that the climate system in the hinterland area of Site 401 was forced into a new climate state that was not easily reversed in the aftermath of the PETM. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Experimental etching with hydrofluoric acid indicated that silica deposition occurs in a recognizable pattern in common sponge microscleres. The postdepositional alteration of these spicules has previously been generally unrecognized or misinterpreted in the literature. Early stages of postdepositional etching of sponge spicules were observed in the acid insoluble fraction of sediments from the West Atlantic barrier reef near Carrie Bow Cay, Belize. Preliminary data on silica distribution in the Belize barrier reef show that concentrations in fine sediment ({\textless}0.25 mm) increase landward of the main reef tract. Sponge spicules are the main component of particulate silica in sediments of the reef and fore-reef where sponge populations abound, whereas grains prevail in the back-reef lagoon deposits. Recycling of locally dissolved silica appears to be important for the growth of many off-shore reef sponges.},

abstract = {Middle to Upper Permian shallow marine carbonates in the Kamura area, Kyushu (SW Japan), were derived from a paleo-atoll complex developed on an ancient seamount in mid-Panthalassa. The Capitanian (Upper Guadalupian) Iwato Formation (19 m-thick dark gray limestone) and the conformably overlying Wuchiapingian (Lower Lopingian) Mitai Formation (17 m-thick light gray dolomitic limestone) are composed of bioclastic limestone of subtidal facies, yielding abundant fusulines. A secular change in stable carbon isotope ratio of carbonate carbon ([delta]13Ccarb) was analyzed in the Kamura section in order to document the oceanographic change in the superocean Panthalassa with respect to the mass extinction across the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary (G-LB). The Iwato Formation is characterized mostly by unusually high positive [delta]13Ccarb values of + 4.9 to + 6.2[per mille sign], whereas the Mitai Formation by low positive values from + 1.9 to + 3.5[per mille sign]. The negative excursion occurred in three steps around the G-LB and the total amount of the negative shifts reached over 4[per mille sign]. A remarkably sharp drop in [delta]13Ccarb values, for 2.4[per mille sign] from 5.3 down to 2.9[per mille sign], occurs in a 2 m-thick interval of the topmost Iwato Formation, after all large-shelled fusulines and bivalves disappeared abruptly. Such a prominent high positive [delta]13Ccarb plateau interval in the end-Guadalupian followed by a large negative shift across the G-LB was detected for the first time, and this trend in the mid-superoceanic sequence is correlated chemostratigraphically in part with the GSSP (Global Stratotype Section and Point) candidate for the G-LB in S. China. The present results prove that the end-Guadalupian event was doubtlessly global in context, affecting circum-Pangean basins, Tethys, and Panthalassa. The end-Guadalupian interval of a high positive plateau in [delta]13Ccarb values over + 5[per mille sign] is particularly noteworthy because it recorded an unusually high bio-productivity period that has not been known in the Permian. This end-Guadalupian high-productivity event, newly named "Kamura event", suggests burial of a huge amount of organic carbon, draw-down of atmospheric CO2 and resultant global cooling at the end of Guadalupian, considerably after the Gondwana glaciation. The low temperatures during the Kamura event may have caused the end-Guadalupian extinction of large-shelled Tethyan fusulines and bivalves adapted to warm climate. On the other hand, the following event of ca. 4[per mille sign] negative shift in [delta]13Ccarb values across the G-LB indicates a global warming in the early Lopingian. This may have allowed radiation of the new Wuchiapingian fauna, and this trend appears to have continued into the Mesozoic. These observations are in good agreement with the global sea-level curve in the Middle-Late Permian. The smooth and gradual pattern of the negative shift suggests that the causal mechanism was not of catastrophic nature (e.g. bolide impact, sudden melting of methane hydrate) but was long and continuous.},

abstract = {Organic matter constitutes a minor fraction of marine and freshwater sediments, yet its important contribution to the sedimentary record can be used to reconstruct marine and continental paleoenvironments. The organic matter content of sediments is the residue of past biota. The amounts and types of organic matter present in sediments consequently reflect environmental conditions that impacted ecosystems at different past times. General sources of the organic matter are inferred from bulk properties such as elemental compositions, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, Rock-Eval pyrolysis data, and organic petrography. Details of organic matter origins are refined by analyses of biomarker molecular compositions. Source changes are proxies for fluctuations in sea-level, oceanic surface currents, and continental climates. Algal paleoproductivity rates are indicated by organic-carbon mass accumulation rates and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic compositions. These parameters record past availability of nutrients and, therefore, are proxies of surface mixing in the oceans and amount of land runoff to lakes. Sea-surface paleotemperatures are recorded by the number of carbon-carbon double bonds in lipid biomarkers produced by marine algae. Larger proportions of the double bonds are proxies for the cooler surface waters that accompanied periods of global glaciation and intervals of enhanced upwelling. The delta(13)C and delta D values of plant organic matter record past concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and changes in delivery of atmospheric moisture, respectively. Diagenesis, which causes the concentration and composition of organic matter in sedimentary settings to differ from those of the original biologically synthesized materials, can bias organic geochemical paleoenvironmental records. The magnitude of this potential source of misinformation must always be considered and evaluated. Comparison of multiple organic geochemical proxies of past conditions helps to compensate for the effects of diagenetic alterations and thereby to improve interpretations of paleoenvironmental change.

abstract = {Authigenic phosphatic laminites enclosed in phosphorite crusts from the shelf off Peru (10 degrees 01' S and 10 degrees 24' S) consist of carbonate fluorapatite layers, which contain abundant sulfide minerals including pyrite (FeS(2)) and sphalerite (ZnS). Low delta(34)S(pyrite) values (average -28.8 per thousand) agree with bacterial sulfate reduction and subsequent pyrite formation. Stable sulfur isotopic compositions of sulfate bound in carbonate fluorapatite are lower than that of sulfate from ambient sea water, suggesting bacterial reoxidation of sulfide by sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. The release of phosphorus and subsequent formation of the autochthonous phosphatic laminites are apparently caused by the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria and associated sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Following an extraction-phosphorite dissolution-extraction procedure, molecular fossils of sulfate-reducing bacteria (mono-O-alkyl glycerol ethers, di-O-alkyl glycerol ethers, as well as the short-chain branched fatty acids i/ai-C(15:0), i/ai-C(17:0) and 10MeC(16:0)) are found to be among the most abundant compounds. The fact that these molecular fossils of sulfate-reducing bacteria are distinctly more abundant after dissolution of the phosphatic laminite reveals that the lipids are tightly bound to the mineral lattice of carbonate fluorapatite. Moreover, compared with the autochthonous laminite, molecular fossils of sulfate-reducing bacteria are: (1) significantly less abundant and (2) not as tightly bound to the mineral lattice in the other, allochthonous facies of the Peruvian crusts consisting of phosphatic coated grains. These observations confirm the importance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the formation of the phosphatic laminite. Model calculations highlight that organic matter degradation by sulfate-reducing bacteria has the potential to liberate sufficient phosphorus for phosphogenesis.},

abstract = {A mat-forming cyanobacterium (Phormidium murrayi West and West) isolated from an ice-shelf pond in Antarctica was grown under white light combined with a range of WA and WE irradiances. The 4-day growth rate decreased under increasing ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with a ninefold greater response to WE relative to UVA. In vivo absorbance spectra showed that UVA and to a greater extent UVB caused a decrease in phycocyanin/chlorophyll a and an increase in carotenoids/chlorophyll a. The phycocyanin/chlorophyll a ratio was closely and positively correlated to the UVB-inhibited growth rate. Under fixed spectral gradients of UV radiation, the growth inhibition effect was dominated by UVB. However, at specific UVB irradiances the inhibition of growth depended on the ratio of UVB to UVA, and growth rates increased linearly with increasing WA. These results are consistent with the view that WE inhibition represents the balance between damage and repair processes that are each controlled by separate wavebands. They also underscore the need to consider UV spectral balance in laboratory and field assays of UVB toxicity.},

abstract = {Data have been obtained, from our own chemical analyses and from the literature, for the concentrations of organic carbon (C) and pyrite sulfur (S) in over 600 samples of Cambrian to recent normal marine shales. (Normal marine refers to deposition in oxygenated bottom water as evidenced by the presence of benthic fossils and/or indicators of bioturbation). All samples were selected to minimize 1. (1) loss of C and/or S due to weathering at the outcrop (by emphasizing the use of drill core material) 2. (2) analytical errors and non-diagenetic effects (by avoiding sediments low in C or S content such as sandstones) 3. (3) Fe limitation of pyrite formation (by avoiding limestones, cherts, and euxinic shales) 4. (4) metamorphic loss of C, relative to S (by avoiding rocks obviously subjected to, even low-grade, metamorphism). Our results indicate that (1) there is generally a good positive linear correlation between organic C and pyrite S for normal marine shales of all ages and (2) the mean C/S ratio for normal marine shales has varied over time. Devonian to Tertiary shales exhibit mean C/S weight ratios (1.8 ± 0.5) somewhat lower than Quaternary sediments (meanC/S = 2.8). This we believe is due to preferential C loss (relative to S) during biogenic methanogenesis plus diagenetic heating. Distinctly lower mean C/S values for the Cambrian and Ordovician (0.5 ± 0.1) cannot be explained solely in terms of diagenetic C loss and, instead, must represent low original ratios. The low original ratios, we suggest, were due mainly to the absence of bacterially refractory organic matter added to the marine environment by rivers at that time, because the major source of such material, vascular land plants, had not yet evolved. This, along with a possibly lower degree of bioturbation, contributed to enhanced pyrite formation and preservation and, thus, lower early Paleozoic C/S ratios.},

abstract = {Conchostracan-rich beds between the Siberian Trap flood basalts and within the thick underlying Hungtukun tuffs of the Tunguska Basin can be closely correlated with conchostracan faunas of Dalongkou (NW China) and the Germanic Basin. The Germanic Basin faunas in turn can be closely correlated with the marine international stratigraphic time scale, and the accuracy of the biostratigraphic correlation of the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) is confirmed by a minimum in ??13Ccarb values at this level. These high-resolution correlations demonstrate conclusively that the PTB is located within the temporally brief but thick Siberian Trap flood basalt sequence. The PTB lies slightly above the level of the main Permo-Triassic extinction event in low latitude marine beds, which occurred at the base of the C. meishanensis-H. praeparvus conodont zone and correlates with the beginning of the Siberian Trap flood basalt event. The main end-Permian continental extinction event was somewhat earlier, within the middle of the C. changxingensis-C. deflecta conodont zone. This horizon marks a mass extinction that devastated a diverse conchostracan fauna and left only low diversity faunas at low and high latitudes. This continental extinction event horizon lies within the middle of the Hungtukun tuffs of the Tunguska Basin and 107m above the base of the Guodikeng Formation at Dalongkou (NW China). A "Triassic type" pioneer flora with numerous lycopod spores appears immediately above this level. Severe high northern and southern latitude marine extinctions occurred concurrently with this continental event, but low latitude marine biota was not then affected. This earlier event is best explained by global warming. The main low latitude extinction event in marine warm water faunas occurred somewhat later and left no signature in high latitude marine faunas or in continental faunas, but it does coincide with a rapid collapse of tropical rain forest environments (disappearance of the highly diverse Gigantopteris flora). This collapse likely was caused by global cooling due to a volcanic winter event. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {The impact of cyanobacteria Gloeocapsa sp. on calcium carbonate precipitation has been examined by combining physico-chemical macroscopic and in-situ microscopic techniques. For this, Ca adsorption and assimilation and kinetic experiments were used to assess the existence of the metabolic process responsible for CaCO3 mineralization by Gloeocapsa sp. Experimental products were characterized by Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM) imaging, XRD analyses, coupled with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Raman micro-spectroscopy. Ca carbonate precipitation experiments were performed at an initial pH of 7.8 to 9.4 and 25°C in supersaturated solutions ($\Omega$calcite=1.5 to 150) in the presence of active cyanobacterial cells. During cyanobacterial photosynthesis, the solution pH increased up to 9.5-10.8 after the first 5-10days of growth, the Ca concentration decreased and the supersaturation index attained a maximum followed by a gradual decrease due to progressive CaCO3 precipitation. Ca adsorption at the surface of live and inactivated Gloeocapsa sp. cells and Ca intracellular assimilation during cell growth were measured as a function of pH and Ca concentration in solution. The contribution of surface adsorption and intracellular uptake to total Ca removal from solution due to biocalcification does not exceed 10{\%}. The presence of calcium carbonate, identified as calcite using Raman spectroscopy, on active Gloeocapsa sp. surfaces and in the vicinity of bacterial cell surfaces was evidenced using SEM. TEM and CLSM demonstrated cyanobacterial cell encrustation by CaCO3 precipitated in the form of nano-spheres adjacent to the cell surface. In contrast to other previously investigated calcifying bacteria, no cellular protection mechanism against Ca2+ adsorption and subsequent carbonate precipitation has been demonstrated for Gloeocapsa sp. This is most likely linked to the specific cellular organization of this species, which involves several cells in one single capsule. As such, planktonic cultures of Gloeocapsa sp. exhibit significant calcifying potential, making them important CO2-fixing microorganisms for both paleo-environmental reconstructions and technological applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we locate the boundary in Antarctica more precisely using carbon isotope chemostratigraphy and total organic carbon analyses in six measured sections from Allan Hills, Shapeless Mountain, Mount Crean, Portal Mountain, Coalsack Bluff and Graphite Peak. Palaeosols and root traces also are useful for recognizing the Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic boundary because there was a complete turnover in terrestrial ecosystems and their soils. A distinctive kind of palaeosol with berthierine nodules, the Dolores pedotype, is restricted to Early Triassic rocks. Late Permian and Middle Triassic root traces are carbonaceous, whereas those of the Early Triassic are replaced by claystone or silica.

Here, we present the result of a laboratory experiment that was designed to test whether formation of carbonate minerals by SRB can occur in the absence of living cells, through passive mineralization of their exopolymeric substances (EPS). SRB capable of mediating dolomite were cultivated in the laboratory, allowing them to secrete EPS. Microbial activity within the cultures was subsequently inhibited with antibiotics. Only after this step, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were added to the solution and carbonate minerals could form. Mg-calcite and disordered Ca-dolomite precipitated in association with EPS. The mol.{\%} of Mg2+ in the crystals increased with longer incubation times. This result demonstrates that organic compounds produced by SRB can mediate the formation of Ca-Mg carbonates in the absence of an active metabolism.},

abstract = {The acidification caused by the dissolution of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean changes the chemistry and hence the bioavailability of iron (Fe), a limiting nutrient in large oceanic regions. Here, we show that the bioavailability of dissolved Fe may decline because of ocean acidification. Acidification of media containing various Fe compounds decreases the Fe uptake rate of diatoms and coccolithophores to an extent predicted by the changes in Fe chemistry. A slower Fe uptake by a model diatom with decreasing pH is also seen in experiments with Atlantic surface water. The Fe requirement of model phytoplankton remains unchanged with increasing CO2. The ongoing acidification of seawater is likely to increase the Fe stress of phytoplankton populations in some areas of the ocean.},

abstract = {Landscapes change because they are the expression of the dynamic interaction between natural and cultural forces in the environment. Cultural landscapes are the result of consecutive reorganization of the land in order to adapt its use and spatial structure better to the changing societal demands. Particularly in Europe, history has recorded many successive and even devastating landscape changes, which have left barely any relics today. Today, the changes are seen as a menace, as a negative evolution because they cause a loss of diversity, coherence and identity, which were characteristic for the traditional cultural landscapes that are rapidly vanishing. This growing concern is also expressed in the European Landscape Convention, which will be used as a start for the analysis in this article. Three periods of landscape dynamics are considered: the traditional landscapes before the important changes that started in the 18th century, the landscapes of the revolutions age of the 19th to 20th century, and the post-modern new landscapes. The combined effect of the driving forces such as accessibility, urbanization, globalization and the impact of calamities have been different in each of the periods and affected the nature and pace of the changes as well as the perception people have had about the landscape. Values change accordingly and so does the way of using and shaping the landscape. It is argued that this changing perception also influences what kind and aspects of landscapes are studied, protected and managed. Diversity and identity of cultural landscapes are central in the discussion. It is shown that coherence between small composing elements in a broader spatial context is important for the legibility of the landscape and that the ability to tell the (his)story of a place strongly enhances the identity and the overall value. This offers criteria for inventorying and assessing landscapes, which is needed to define future management and development. Although the general trends of future development of the European landscapes are rather well known, planning and managing future landscape remains difficult and extremely uncertain. The processes and management in past traditional landscapes and the manifold relations people have towards the perceivable environment and the symbolic meaning it generates, offer valuable knowledge for more sustainable planning and management for future landscapes. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The carbon ($\delta$13Corg) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) isotopic compositions of bulk organic matter were analyzed in two high-resolution Permian-Triassic transitional sections containing microbialite in south China. The results from these shallow-marine sections show that an abrupt negative shift in $\delta$15N, from ∼+3‰ to ∼0‰, occurred immediately after the latest Permian mass extinction (LPE) in both sections, concurrent with a distinct negative shift in $\delta$13Corg. The persistently low values of $\delta$15N suggest that, following the LPE, microbial nitrogen fixation became the main source of biologically available nitrogen in the Nanpanjiang Basin and perhaps over a broader region of the eastern Paleotethys Ocean. Enhanced N fixation is probably indicative of the prevalence of stratified anoxic water masses characterized by intense denitrification and/or anaerobic ammonium oxidation at the time. Perturbation of the marine nitrogen cycle might have contributed to high temperatures following the main marine mass extinction through the release of the greenhouse gas N2O. The sharp declines in $\delta$15N and $\delta$13Corg may be ascribed to an abrupt change in shallow-water microbial communities, which differed in composition from contemporaneous deep-water communities.},

To sequester or take up these micronutrients, various microorganisms apparently release strong complexing agents and catalyze redox reactions that modify the bioavailability of trace metals and promote their rapid cycling in the upper water column. In turn, the low availability of some metals controls the rate of photosynthesis in parts of the oceans and the transformation and uptake of major nutrients such as nitrogen. The extremely low concentrations of several essential metals are both the cause and the result of ultraefficient uptake systems in the plankton and of widespread replacement of metals by one another for various biochemical functions.},

abstract = {The MEDIA (Modelling Early DIAgenesis) software package comprises a flexible and extensible software system that provides problem-solving assistance for simulating 1D reactive transport in surface sediments. MEDIA allows multiple diagenetic models to be built by extending a model template with new model components from a toolbox of available objects (elements, species, parameters, reactions). A detailed review is given of the transport and reaction components available for model construction. Upon assemblage, the model is channelled to the numerical subunit of the MEDIA package. Via a canonical transformation, the user-defined mixed kinetic-equilibrium model is rearranged into a proper set of differential algebraic equations (DAE), for which both steady state and transient solutions can be calculated. Steady-state profiles are obtained either directly using a Newton-Raphson method, or alternatively, as the asymptotic result of a dynamic simulation. Dynamic simulations involve a global implicit procedure based on the stiff- ODE solver package VODE, employing a direct substitution approach to reduce the number of equations in the DAE system. Verification of the MEDIA code was accomplished (1) by comparison with analytic models and (2) by emulating the model formulation and output of the existing diagenetic model code STEADYSED. As an example application, a diagenetic model was constructed to analyse an extensive dataset collected from a marine sediment in the Santa Barbara Basin (California). The different pathways of organic matter mineralization were modelled, and the coupling among the biogeochemical cycles of C, O, N, S, Mn and Fe was investigated. Depth profiles of both porewater and solid-phase constituents could be reproduced with great accuracy},

abstract = {Although mass extinctions probably account for the disappearance of less than 5{\%} of all extinct species, the evolutionary opportunities they have created have had a disproportionate effect on the history of life. Theoretical considerations and simulations have suggested that the empty niches created by a mass extinction should refill rapidly after extinction ameliorates. Under logistic models, this biotic rebound should be exponential, slowing as the environmental carrying capacity is approached. Empirical studies reveal a more complex dynamic, including positive feedback and an exponential growth phase during recoveries. Far from a model of refilling ecospace, mass extinctions appear to cause a collapse of ecospace, which must be rebuilt during recovery. Other generalities include the absence of a clear correlation between the magnitude of extinction and the pace of recovery or the resulting ecological and evolutionary disruption the presence of a survival interval, with few originations, immediately after an extinction and preceding the recovery phase, and the presence of many lineages that persist through an extinction event only to disappear during the subsequent recovery. Several recoveries include numerous missing lineages, groups that are found before the extinction, then latter in the recovery, but are missing during the initial survival–recovery phase. The limited biogeographic studies of recoveries suggest considerable variability between regions.},

abstract = {Sapropel layers in the sediment record of the Mediterranean Sea reflect periods of climate-induced elevated marine production associated with precessional minima. Some of these layers feature interruptions that represent centennial-to-millennial returns to the predominantly low-productivity conditions of this sea. We have measured multiple geochemical paleoproductivity proxies in the interrupted sapropel layer that corresponds to insolation cycle 90 (955 ka) at 1-cm intervals in a four-site transect from the Balearic Basin to the Levantine Basin to assess similarities and differences in its expression at the four locations. The interrupted sapropels are similarly divided by an organic-carbon-poor interval into an upper layer in which organic carbon concentrations reach 2-7 wt.{\%} and a lower layer in which they peak between 1 and 3 wt.{\%}. The interruption was essentially synchronous in the Balearic Basin, the Tyrrhenian Basin, and the Ionian Basin, but it was delayed and shorter in the Levantine Basin. Lighter nitrogen isotope compositions consistently accompany higher organic carbon accumulation rates in the sapropel layers, which implies a shift from coccolith-dominated organic matter production towards a mode of primary production in which cyanobacteria were important during times of sapropel deposition. Organic carbon isotopic compositions become heavier as organic carbon accumulation increases at three of the locations, which is consistent with elevated productivity. However, they become lighter at the Levantine Basin site, which suggests greater delivery of isotopically light fluvial waters to this part of the Mediterranean Sea. The local paleoclimate conditions conducive to sapropel formation evidently were not completely uniform across the Mediterranean region but their occurrences were synchronous. Moreover, the co-existence of an essentially same-age interruption of the sapropels at the four locations shows that climate could change rapidly and concordantly across the region at much less than precessional intervals. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Comparison of rates of accumulation of organic carbon in surface marine sediments from the central North Pacific, the continental margins off northwest Africa, northwest and southwest America, the Argentine Basin, and the western Baltic Sea with primary production rates suggests that the fraction of primary produced organic carbon preserved in the sediments is universally related to the bulk sedimentation rate. Accordingly, less than 0.01{\%} of the primary production becomes fossilized in slowly accumulating pelagic sediments [(2 to 6 mm (1000 y)-1] of the Central Pacific, 0.1 to 2{\%} in moderately rapidly accumulating [2 to 13 cm (1000 y)-1] hemipelagic sediments off northwest Africa, northwest America (Oregon) and southeast America (Argentina), and 11 to 18{\%} in rapidly accumulating [66 to 140 cm (1000 y)-1] hemipelagic sediments off southwest America (Peru) and in the Baltic Sea. The emiprical expression: {\%}Org-C= 0.0030?? R ?? S 0.30 ps(1-??) implies that the sedimentary organic carbon content ({\%} Org-C) doubles with each 10-fold increase in sedimentation rate (S), assuming that other factors remain constant; i.e., primary production (R), porosity (??) and sediment density (ps). This expression also predicts the sedimentary organic carbon content from the primary production rate, sedimentation rate, dry density of solids, and their porosity; it may be used to estimate paleoproductivity as well. Applying this relationship to a sediment core from the continental rise off northwest Africa (Spanish Sahara) suggests that productivity there during interglacial oxygen isotope stages 1 and 5 was about the same as today but was higher by a factor of 2 to 3 during glacial stages 2, 3, and 6. ?? 1979.},

abstract = {Realistic appraisal of paleoclimatic information obtained from a particular location requires accurate knowledge of its paleolatitude defined relative to the Earth's spin-axis. This is crucial to, among others, correctly assess the amount of solar energy received at a location at the moment of sediment deposition. The paleolatitude of an arbitrary location can in principle be reconstructed from tectonic plate reconstructions that (1) restore the relative motions between plates based on (marine) magnetic anomalies, and (2) reconstruct all plates relative to the spin axis using a paleomagnetic reference frame based on a global apparent polar wander path. Whereas many studies do employ high-quality relative plate reconstructions, the necessity of using a paleomagnetic reference frame for climate studies rather than a mantle reference frame appears under-appreciated. In this paper, we briefly summarize the theory of plate tectonic reconstructions and their reference frames tailored towards applications of paleoclimate reconstruction, and show that using a mantle reference frame, which defines plate positions relative to the mantle, instead of a paleomagnetic reference frame may introduce errors in paleolatitude of more than 15° ({\textgreater}1500 km). This is because mantle reference frames cannot constrain, or are specifically corrected for the effects of true polar wander. We used the latest, state-of-the-art plate reconstructions to build a global plate circuit, and developed an online, user-friendly paleolatitude calculator for the last 200 million years by placing this plate circuit in three widely used global apparent polar wander paths. As a novelty, this calculator adds error bars to paleolatitude estimates that can be incorporated in climate modeling. The calculator is available at www.paleolatitude.org. We illustrate the use of the paleolatitude calculator by showing how an apparent wide spread in Eocene sea surface temperatures of southern high latitudes may be in part explained by a much wider paleolatitudinal distribution of sites than previously assumed.},

abstract = {Early Triassic oceans were characterized by deposition of a number of "anachronistic facies", including microbialites, seafloor carbonate cement fans, and giant ooids. Giant ooids were particularly prevalent in Lower Triassic sections across South China and exhibit unusual features that may provide insights into marine environmental conditions following the end-Permian mass extinction. The section at Moyang (Guizhou Province) contains abundant giant ooids ranging in size between 2 and 6mm (maximum 12mm) and exhibiting various cortical structures, including regular, deformed, compound, regenerated and "domed". Preservation of ooid cortical structure is generally good as indicated by petrographic observations, and trace element and carbon isotope analyses suggest that diagenesis occurred in a closed diagenetic system. All ooids exhibit fine concentric laminae, frequently alternating between light-colored coarsely crystalline and dark-colored finely crystalline layers probably reflecting variation in organic content or original mineralogy. Under scanning electron microscope, biomineralized filaments or biofilms and tiny carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) crystals are commonly found in the finely crystalline layers. We infer that the precipitation of CFA was related to adsorption of P via microbial activity on the surfaces of ooids following episodic incursions of deep waters rich in CO2, H2S and phosphate into shallow-marine environments. Giant ooid precipitation may have been promoted in shallow ramp settings during these events by increased watermass agitation and supersaturation with respect to CaCO3, as well as reduced carbonate removal rates through biotic skeletal formation. Spatio-temporal distribution data reveal that giant ooids were widespread in the Tethyan region during the Early Triassic, and that they were most abundant immediately after the end-Permian crisis and disappeared gradually as metazoans repopulated marine environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A high-resolution laminated sediment record from the oxygen-minimum zone in the northeastern Arabian Sea off Pakistan was studied to reconstruct climatic variations. To infer the monsoon-driven {\textordfeminine}moisture history{\textordmasculine} in the northeastern Arabian Sea during the past 5000 years, we have used three types of independant proxies: (1) varve thickness, (2) stable isotope ratios of planktic foraminifera; and (3) inorganic geochemical composition. On the basis of these proxies we have subdivided the sedimentary record into {\textregistered}ve intervals. The {\textregistered}rst time interval from 5000 to 3900 yr BP (Period I) is dominated by summermonsoon activity. Deduced from Ti/Al, Zr/Al, K/Al and Sr/Ca ratios and oxygen-isotope data of planktonic foraminifera slightly enhanced winter-monsoon conditions can be inferred for the period from 3900 to about 3000 yr BP (Period II). Maximum precipitation during enhanced winter-monsoon activity at about 3100 yr BP was followed by an onset of aridi{\textregistered}cation at 3000 yr BP which continued until about 2000±2200 yr BP (Period III). The textural, mineralogical and geochemical data suggest that this aridi{\textregistered}cation was a gradual, century-scale process rather than an abrupt event. Comparison to late Holocene records in NW- and SW-India, the Near East and tropical Africa supports our interpretation that Period III from 3000 to 2000 yr BP is characterized by a gradual change in the atmospherical moisture budget over much of this area. Reduced monsoonal rainfall may be linked to variations of Eurasian snow cover. As deduced from varve thickness and element to Al-ratios, Period IV from 2000 to about 1500 yr BP is characterized by a summer-monsoon dominated sequence with higher precipitation than during Period III. The d 18O record shows an abrupt shift at 2000 yr BP coinciding with an increase of varve thickness which suggests a cooling of surface waters in the northern Arabian Sea. Present-day conditions in the Makran area were established at 1500 yr BP (Period V). Based on inorganic geochemical data and meteorological records at several stations in the Makran we conclude that Period V is dominated by precipitation during the winter season. Here, declined rainfall associated with the summer-monsoon may be related to a less northward position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during summer and a stronger in¯uence of winter-monsoon linked phenomenona.},

In addition, morphological web-like structures typical for microbial mats, as well as the recognition of 2{\^{I}}±-methylhopanes and monomethyl-alkane cyanobacteria biomarkers is evidenced of microbial activity after the global Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) extinction event. The presence of cyanobacterial mats also suggests suboxic to oxic environments and at the same time photic bottom water conditions. However, isorenieratane and its derivatives were detected in almost all samples. The presence of this well-known biomarker of green sulfur bacteria implies that euxinic conditions were present in the upper part of the water column at least intermittently or that temporal euxinia occurred in the water column. Presence of euxinic conditions is confirmed by the occurrence of small-sized pyrite framboids which were particularly dominant in the lower part of the section. The shift towards low $\delta$13C values in both micritic limestones and in sedimentary organic matter seen at the beginning of the period of diminished photic zone, might reflect an influx of newly respired CO2 to surface waters, caused by enhanced respiration at depth after the F/F transition in the Ch{\"{A}}™ciny-Zbrza basin.},

abstract = {We present new sulfur and oxygen isotope data in sulfate (??34SSO4 and ??18OSO4 , respectively), from globally distributed marine and estuary pore fluids. We use this data with a model of the biochemical steps involved in bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) to explore how the slope on a ??18OSO4 vs. ??34SSO4 plot relates to the net sulfate reduction rate (nSRR) across a diverse range of natural environments. Our data demonstrate a correlation between the nSRR and the slope of the relative evolution of oxygen and sulfur isotopes (??18OSO4 vs. ??34SSO4) in the residual sulfate pool, such that higher nSRR results in a lower slope (sulfur isotopes increase faster relative to oxygen isotopes). We combine these results with previously published literature data to show that this correlation scales over many orders of magnitude of nSRR. Our model of the mechanism of BSR indicates that the critical parameter for the relative evolution of oxygen and sulfur isotopes in sulfate during BSR in natural environments is the rate of intracellular sulfite oxidation. In environments where sulfate reduction is fast, such as estuaries and marginal marine environments, this sulfite reoxidation is minimal, and the ??18OSO4 increases more slowly relative to the ??34SSO4. In contrast, in environments where sulfate reduction is very slow, such as deep sea sediments, our model suggests sulfite reoxidation is far more extensive, with as much as 99{\%} of the sulfate being thus recycled; in these environments the ??18OSO4 increases much more rapidly relative to the ??34SSO4. We speculate that the recycling of sulfite plays a physiological role during BSR, helping maintain microbial activity where the availability of the electron donor (e.g. available organic matter) is low. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

These competing "contemporary climate" vs "historic climate" hypotheses have been vigorously debated without reaching consensus. Here, we test the proposition that European species richness of reptiles and amphibians is driven by climate changes in the Quaternary. We find that climate stability between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present day is a better predictor of species richness than contemporary climate; and that the 0 degrees C isotherm of the LGM delimits the distributions of narrow-ranging species, whereas the current 0 degrees C isotherm limits the distributions of wide-ranging species. Our analyses contradict previous studies of large-scale species richness patterns and support the view that "historic climate" can contribute to current species richness independently of and at least as much as contemporary climate.},

Within the Julfian and across the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary, two sharp upward decreases in carbonate and organic matter ??13C values (each 4??? PDB in magnitude) are observed. Both are best explained by mixing of a deep-water mass having low ??13C values and a shallow-water mass having high ??13C compositions. Early Triassic ??13C values, initially low (1??? PDB), increase to 3??? PDB within 100 m above the P-T boundary. Variations in ??13C compositions of carbonate and organic matter and changes in ??13C (=??13Ccar - ??13Corg) indicate that Early Triassic ??13C values were controlled by productivity cycles.

abstract = {Accurate interpretation of paleoproductivity proxies in the Southern Ocean requires "ground truthing" these proxies. Here the concentrations of total Ba, organic carbon (Corg), and biogenic silica (Sibio), along with other redox-sensitive trace metals (Cd, Re, and Mo), are compared with the distribution of silver (Ag) in core top sediments from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Conventional thinking holds that enrichment of trace metals should be muted or absent in Southern Ocean sediments despite high export of Corg from surface waters because deposition under well-oxygenated bottom waters inhibits accumulation of reduced metal phases. While our data support this prediction, detectable preserved vertical fluxes of Ag, Cd, and Re exist beneath the opal belt and faithfully record surface productivity patterns. Therefore we suggest Ag fluxes into Southern Ocean sediments occur via biodetritus associated with high export production rather than accumulation by redox-driven diagenetic processes. Sedimentary Ag concentrations are likely altered at the seafloor by biogenic particle remineralization due to high bottom water O2. Nevertheless, zonal Ag fluxes are similar to surface productivity patterns, highlighting the potential of Ag to serve as a proxy for diatom export production. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Over the next few centuries, with unabated emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), a total of 5000 Pg C may enter the atmosphere, causing CO2 concentrations to rise to approximately 2000 ppmv, global temperature to warm by more than 8(°)C and surface ocean pH to decline by approximately 0.7 units. A carbon release of this magnitude is unprecedented during the past 56 million years-and the outcome accordingly difficult to predict. In this regard, the geological record may provide foresight to how the Earth system will respond in the future. Here, we discuss the long-term legacy of massive carbon release into the Earth's surface reservoirs, comparing the Anthropocene with a past analogue, the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, approx. 56 Ma). We examine the natural processes and time scales of CO2 neutralization that determine the atmospheric lifetime of CO2 in response to carbon release. We compare the duration of carbon release during the Anthropocene versus PETM and the ensuing effects on ocean acidification and marine calcifying organisms. We also discuss the conundrum that the observed duration of the PETM appears to be much longer than predicted by models that use first-order assumptions. Finally, we comment on past and future mass extinctions and recovery times of biotic diversity.},

abstract = {The end-Ordovician extinction consisted of two discrete pulses, both linked, in various ways, to glaciation at the South Pole. The first phase, starting just below the Normalograptus extraordinarius Zone, particularly affected nektonic and planktonic species, while the second pulse, associated with the Normalograptus persculptus Zone, was less selective. Glacially induced cooling and oxygenation are two of many suggested kill mechanisms for the end-Ordovician extinction, but a general consensus is lacking. We have used geochemical redox indicators, such as iron speciation, molybdenum concentrations, pyrite framboid size distribution and sulfur isotopes to analyze the geochemistry in three key Hirnantian sections. These indicators reveal that reducing conditions were occasionally present at all three sites before the first pulse of the end-Ordovician extinction, and that these conditions expanded towards the second pulse. Even though the N. extraordinarius Zone appears to have been a time of oxygenated deposition, pyrite is significantly enriched in 34S in our sections as well as in sections reported from South China. This suggests a widespread reduction in marine sulfate concentrations, which we attribute to an increase in pyrite burial during the early Hirnantian. The S-isotope excursion coincides with a major positive carbon isotope excursion indicating elevated rates of organic carbon burial as well. We argue that euxinic conditions prevailed and intensified in the early Hirnantian oceans, and that a concomitant global sea level lowering pushed the chemocline deeper than the depositional setting of our sites. In the N. persculptus Zone, an interval associated with a major sea level rise, our redox indicators suggests that euxinic conditions, and ferruginous in some places, encroached onto the continental shelves. In our model, the expansion of euxinic conditions during the N. extraordinarius Zone was generated by a reorganization of nutrient cycling during sea level fall, and we argue, overall, that these dynamics in ocean chemistry played an important role for the end-Ordovician mass extinction. During the first pulse of the extinction, euxinia and a steepened oxygen gradient in the water column caused habitat loss for deep-water benthic and nektonic organisms. During the second pulse, the transgression of anoxic water onto the continental shelves caused extinction in shallower habitats. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fossil bioapatite may yield biogeochemical signals of paleoenvironments captured by living organisms. Bioapatite may be diagenetically altered, however, with ions added or removed post-mortem; such change is typically assessed using destructive and demanding techniques. Here, Raman spectroscopy is used as a rapid and non-destructive way to identify significant diagenetic alteration of fossil bioapatite. We found spectral parameters of phosphate symmetric stretching ($\nu$1-PO4 3−) to be very sensitive to variations in apatite chemistry, particularly with respect to common diagenetic components (CO3 2−,F−,Sr2+). The Raman spectral parameters were subsequently applied to a set of modern (biogenic) and geologic (magmatic) apatite samples as potential endmembers for diagenetic alteration. Raman spectra were also collected from enamel and dentin (respectively resistant vs. alteration-prone) of fossil teeth. Phosphate-oxygen isotopic values from the same enamel–dentin samples were used as an index of alteration and provided definition of Raman spectral parameters as relates to diagenetic alteration. Diagenetically altered samples were characterised by spectra with $\nu$1-PO4 3− widths (at half maximum height) less than 13.0 cm−1, and $\nu$1-PO4 3− band positions greater than 964.7 cm−1. Raman spectroscopy is shown to have potential as a tool for pre-screening fossil apatite samples before further analyses. {\textcopyright}},

Through a repeated cycle of sulfide oxidation to S0 and subsequent disproportionation, these bacteria can deplete sedimentary sulfides in sulfur-34. A prediction, borne out by observation, is that more extensive sulfide oxidation will lead to sulfides that are more depleted in sulfur-34. Thus, the oxidative part of the sulfur cycle creates circumstances by which sulfides become more depleted in sulfur-34 than would be possible with sulfate-reducing bacteria alone.},

abstract = {This paper is a synthesis of the use of selected trace elements as proxies for reconstruction of paleoproductivity and paleoredox conditions. Many of the trace elements considered here show variations in oxidation state and solubility as a function of the redox status of the depositional environment. Redox-sensitive trace metals tend to be more soluble under oxidizing conditions and less soluble under reducing conditions, resulting in authigenic enrichments in oxygen-depleted sedimentary facies. This behavior makes U, V and Mo, and to a lesser extent certain other trace metals such as Cr and Co, useful as paleoredox proxies. Some redox-sensitive elements are delivered to the sediment mainly in association with organic matter (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd) and they may be retained within the sediment in association with pyrite, after organic matter decay in reducing sediment. This particularity confers to Ni and Cu a good value as proxies for organic C sinking flux (frequently referred to as productivity). Elements with only one oxidation state such as Ba and P are classically used to assess paleoproductivity levels but they suffer from the fact that they are solubilized under reducing conditions and may be lost from oxygen-deprived sediments. The combined used of U, V and Mo enrichments may allow suboxic environments to be distinguished from anoxic-euxinic ones. Specifically, these elements tend to be much more strongly enriched in anoxic-euxinic environments and to exhibit weaker covariation with TOC than in suboxic environments.},

abstract = {Stratigraphic records from northwestern Pangea provide unique insight into global processes that occurred during the latest Permian extinction (LPE). We examined a detailed geochemical record of the Festningen section, Spitsbergen. A stepwise extinction is noted as: starting with (1) loss of carbonate shelly macrofauna, followed by (2) loss of siliceous sponges in conjunction with an abrupt change in ichnofabrics as well as dramatic change in the terrestrial environment, and (3) final loss of all trace fossils. We interpret loss of carbonate producers as related to shoaling of the lysocline in higher latitudes, in relationship to building atmospheric CO2. The loss of siliceous sponges is coincident with the global LPE event and is related to onset of high loading rates of toxic metals (Hg, As, Co) that we suggest are derived from Siberian Trap eruptions. The final extinction stage is coincident with redox-sensitive trace metal and other proxy data that suggest onset of anoxia after the other extinction events. These results show a remarkable record of progressive environmental deterioration in northwestern Pangea during the extinction crises.},

abstract = {Studies of the end-Permian mass extinction have suggested a variety of patterns from a single catastrophic event to multiple phases. But most of these analyses have been based on fossil distributions from single localities. Although single sections may simplify the interpretation of species diversity, they are susceptible to bias from stratigraphic incompleteness and facies control of preservation. Here we use a data set of 1450 species from 18 fossiliferous sections in different paleoenvironmental settings across South China and the northern peri-Gondwanan region, and integrate it with high-precision geochronologic data to evaluate the rapidity of the largest Phanerozoic mass extinction. To reduce the Signor-Lipps effect, we applied constrained optimization (CONOP) to search for an optimal sequence of first and last occurrence datums for all species and generate a composite biodiversity pattern based on multiple sections. This analysis indicates that an abrupt extinction of 62{\%} of species took place within 200 Kyr. The onset of the sudden extinction is around 252.3 Ma, just below Bed 25 at the Meishan section. Taxon turnover and diversification rates suggest a deterioration of the living conditions nearly 1.2 Myr before the sudden extinction. The magnitude of the extinction was such that there was no immediate biotic recovery. Prior suggestions of highly variable, multi-phased extinction patterns reflect the impact of the Signor-Lipps effect and facies-dependent occurrences, and are not supported following appropriate statistical treatment of this larger data set.},

abstract = {During the Cretaceous period ({\~{}}145–65 million years ago), there were several periods of global ocean anoxia, each lasting less than one million years. These events, known as ocean anoxic events, were marked by significant increases in organic carbon burial, and are generally attributed to increased primary productivity in surface waters. The details underpinning the initiation, maintenance and termination of these events, however, remain equivocal. Here we present sulphur isotope data spanning the Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (about 94.5 million years ago) from sedimentary rocks in Colorado that were formed in the Western Interior Seaway; this seaway ran north–south, splitting North America during the Cretaceous. Sulphate levels increased rapidly from relatively low background levels at the onset of the event, most likely from the release of sulphur by massive volcanism, and fell during the anoxic event. We infer that the input of sulphate facilitated increased carbon remineralization, which enhanced nutrient recycling and increased global primary productivity, eventually resulting in widespread ocean anoxia. Our scenario indicates that Ocean Anoxic Event 2 may have persisted until sulphate levels were stabilized by the formation and burial of the sulphur mineral pyrite, which returned primary productivity to background levels. We suggest that fluctuations in sulphate levels may have regulated the marine carbon cycle during past periods of low oceanic sulphate concentration.},

abstract = {Between summer of 1996 and 1997, a continuous set of samples was collected in a sediment trap at 140-m water depth at a station in the central Gotland Sea. Fluxes of total sedimented matter, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, biogenic silica and particulate phosphorus as well as the isotopic composition of organic carbon and nitrogen were estimated. The total vertical particles flux was found to be 35 g m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 year{\^{a}}ˆ'1 and fluxes of organic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus and biogenic silica amounted to 6.0, 0.8, 0.19 and 6.2 g m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 year{\^{a}}ˆ'1, respectively. Highest rates of vertical particle-transport for all compounds occurred in September 1996 and lowest fluxes during October{\^{a}}€“February. Based on the isotopic signature in the particulate nitrogen, fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by pelagic cyanobacteria could be identified as the major source for export production during the summer season. The isotopic composition of the spring sedimentation pulse indicates uptake of a mixture of laterally introduced and locally produced nitrate accumulated in the winter mixed layer during the non-growth season. The contribution of nitrogen fixation to the sedimentary nitrogen inventory in the central Gotland Sea is estimated to be in the range of 45{\%}. This is consistent with nitrogen isotope data of surface sediments and budged calculations. Annual accumulation rates of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the underlying sediments (at 241-m water depth) are two- to sevenfold higher than the measured vertical particle flux indicating laterally advected material as the main source for sediment formation in this depositional area. The stable isotope composition of organic carbon and nitrogen of surface sediments was comparable to a weighted annual mean from the sediment trap samples, implying the source of bulk sedimentary organic matter originates from the pelagial of the central Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {The controversial Capitanian (Middle Permian, 262 Ma) extinction event is only known from equatorial latitudes, and consequently its global extent is poorly resolved. We demonstrate that there were two, severe extinctions amongst brachiopods in northern Boreal latitudes (Spitsbergen) in the Middle to Late Permian, separated by a recovery phase. New age dating of the Spitsbergen strata (belonging to the Kapp Starostin Formation), using strontium isotopes and $\delta$13C trends and comparison with better-dated sections in Greenland, suggests that the first crisis occurred in the Capitanian. This age assignment indicates that this Middle Permian extinction is manifested at higher latitudes. Redox proxies (pyrite framboids and trace metals) show that the Boreal crisis coincided with an intensification of oxygen depletion, implicating anoxia in the extinction scenario. The widespread and near-total loss of carbonates across the Boreal Realm also suggests a role for acidification in the crisis. The recovery interval saw the appearance of new brachiopod and bivalve taxa alongside survivors, and an increased mollusk dominance, resulting in an assemblage reminiscent of younger Mesozoic assemblages. The subsequent end-Permian mass extinction terminated this Late Permian radiation.},

An analysis of eight Lower Triassic sections from the northern Yangtze Platform and Nanpanjiang Basin, representing water depths of {\~{}}50 to 500m, allowed reconstruction of $\delta$$\delta$13CDIC in Early Triassic seas of the South China craton for seven time slices representing four negative (N) and three positive (P) carbon-isotope excursions: 8.5{\%} (N1), 5.8{\%} (P1), 3.5{\%} (N2), 6.5{\%} (P2), 7.8{\%} (N3), -1.9{\%} (P3), and 2.2{\%} (N4). These values are much larger than vertical $\delta$13CDIC gradients in the modern ocean ({\~{}}1-3{\%}) due to intensified stratification and reduced vertical mixing in Early Triassic seas. Peaks in $\delta$$\delta$13CDIC around the PTB (N1) and in the early to mid-Smithian (P2-N3) coincided with episodes of strong climatic warming, reduced marine productivity, and expanded ocean anoxia. The Dienerian-Smithian boundary marks the onset of a major mid-Early Triassic disturbance, commencing {\~{}}1Myr after the latest Permian mass extinction, that we link to a second eruptive stage of the Siberian Traps. Inhospitable oceanic conditions generally persisted until the early Spathian, when strong climatic cooling caused re-invigoration of global-ocean circulation, leading to an interval of negative $\delta$$\delta$13CDIC values and a sharp increase in $\delta$13Ccarb driven by upwelling of nutrient-rich deepwaters. These developments marked the end of the main eruptive stage of the Siberian Traps. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Anomalous departures of rare-earth elements (REE) from similarity of chemical behaviour are most evident in a comparison of Ce with its neighbors. Under reducing conditions Ce3+ acts like other REE, but oxidized Ce4+ is adsorbed on Mn-, Fe-oxyhydroxides, or organic particulates, and consequently the remaining solution will tend to exhibit a negative Ce anomaly. In addition, more subtle fractionations may emphasize the light, or the heavy, or the middle REE. A pattern of REE may be recorded by immediate diagenesis on a suitable chemical substrate, such as apatite (fish debris, conodonts), carbonate or chert. This record was originally thought to reflect the paleoredox conditions of primary deposition. However, any such primary record may be overprinted by late diagenetic alteration. Early analyses of REE in conodonts from a wide range of sediments suggested a prevalence of reducing conditions (no Ce anomaly) in pre-Carboniferous oceans, and more common oxidation (negative Ce anomaly) in the late Paleozoic. However, recent research by other investigators indicates that variations in Cean are more diverse in origin, and in particular many are distorted to an unknown extent by late diagenesis. In any case it is now clear that geological age does not show a consistent relationship to the level of the Ce anomaly. The Ce anomaly apparently does not play any regular role in the isotopic events that accompany prominent mass extinctions. Further research is required to understand, and thus make useful, the controls on the Ce anomaly.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of the eventual control of barium concentration in seawater by an equilibrium with barite. For this, we have used a new thermodynamic model to compute the barite saturation index of ocean waters, mainly from GEOSECS data. Our results show that equilibrium between barite and seawater is reached in a number of places: cold surface waters of the Southern Ocean, waters at intermediate depths (2000-3500 m) in the Pacific, deep waters (2000-3500 m) of the Gulf of Bengal. The only samples for which a slight barite supersaturation is found are the surface waters at GEOSECS station G89 in the Weddell Gyre. Besides these locations, the rest of the world's oceans is undersaturated, as was established by Church and Wolgemuth [Church, T.M., Wolgemuth, K., 1972. Marine barite saturation, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 15 35-44,]. There is a return to undersaturation of the water column at depths of about 3500 m in the Pacific and of about 2500 m in the Southern Ocean. The reverse is found for GEOSECS station 446 in the Gulf of Bengal for which the highest Ba concentrations can be found at depth: surface waters are undersaturated and equilibrium is reached below 2000 m. Finally, we briefly discuss the role of biogenic and inorganic processes on barite formation in the ocean as well as the influence of strontium substitution in marine barites.},

Here, we present a detailed spatial and temporal record of Ediacaran ocean chemistry for the Doushantuo Formation in the Nanhua Basin, South China. We find evidence for a metastable zone of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) waters impinging on the continental shelf and sandwiched within ferruginous [Fe(II)-enriched] deep waters. A stratified ocean with coeval oxic, sulfidic, and ferruginous zones, favored by overall low oceanic sulfate concentrations, was maintained dynamically throughout the Ediacaran Period. Our model reconciles seemingly conflicting geochemical redox conditions proposed previously for Ediacaran deep oceans and helps to explain the patchy temporal record of early metazoan fossils.},

abstract = {The TEX86 (TetraEther indeX of tetraethers consisting of 86 carbon atoms) paleothermometer is based on the relative dis- tribution of archaeal lipids, i.e. isoprenoid glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), and is increasingly used to reconstruct past sea water temperatures. To establish a more extensive, global calibration of the TEX86 paleothermometer, we analyzed GDGTs in 287 (in comparison with 44 in currently used calibration) core-top sediments distributed over the world oceans and deposited at different depths. Comparisons of TEX86 data with (depth-weighted) annual mean temperatures of the overlying waters between 0 m and 4000 m as well as with different seasonal mean temperatures at 0m water depth showed that the TEX86 proxy reflects mostly annual mean temperatures of the upper mixed layer. The relationship between TEX86 values and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) was non-linear mainly because below 5 C the change in TEX86 values was minor with temperature. This suggests that the TEX86 proxy might not be directly applicable for the Polar Oceans. Nevertheless, between 5 C and 30 C, the TEX86 proxy has a strong linear relationship with SSTs. Here, we, therefore, propose a new linear calibration model (T = 10.78 + 56.2 * TEX86, r2 = 0.935, n = 223) for past SST reconstructions using the TEX86 palaeothermometer.},

abstract = {The 3.43 billion-year-old Strelley Pool Chert, Pilbara Craton, Western Australia, contains compelling evidence of Early Archaean life in the form of kilometre-sized remnants of an ancient stromatolitic carbonate platform. Reviewing and building on earlier studies, we examine the fossilized remains of the platform to seek ecosystem-scale insights to Earth's early biosphere, examining the evidence for biosedimentation, and the importance and effect of different environmental processes on biological activity. Both vertical and lateral trends show that stromatolite abundance and diversity are greatest in the area interpreted as an isolated, partially restricted, peritidal marine carbonate platform, or reef, where there is virtually no trace of hydrothermal or terrigenous clastic input. In contrast, stromatolites are poorly developed or absent among hydrothermal, volcaniclastic or terrigenous clastic sedimentary facies, and are absent in deeper marine settings that are laterally equivalent to shallow marine stromatolitic facies. Hydrothermal veins, some of which were previously interpreted as vents that exhaled fluids from which the stromatolitic structures precipitated, are shown to postdate the stromatolites. On the platform, stromatolite facies associations varied between different palaeoenvironments, but some stromatolite types occurred across different palaeoenvironments, highlighting the combined influence of biological and environmental processes on stromatolite formation. The regional distribution of stromatolites in the palaeoenvironment suggests a biological response to variations in water depth, sediment influx and hydrothermal activity with stromatolite formation favoured by relatively 'normal' shallow marine environments with low clastic/chemical sedimentation rates and no direct input from high temperature hydrothermal systems. The lithology, structure and fabrics of the stromatolites, and their close association with abundant evaporite crystal pseudomorphs, indicate that evaporitic precipitation was probably the dominant non-biological process that contributed to stromatolite formation. The study supports a biological interpretation for the origin of the stromatolites, and reveals compelling evidence for the conditions that favoured biological activity on the early Earth and formation of macroscopic biosignatures that could be preserved for most of Earth's history. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {High-resolution down-core analyses of the solid phase content of total barium (Batot) and total organic carbon (TOC) back to 25 kyr B.P. were performed on a gravity core from the upper continental slope off Cape Yubi (Morocco). The observed discrepancy between the two potential paleoproductivity proxies, Batot and TOC, initiated supplementary examinations of the pore water, the geochemistry of the clay fraction, X-ray diffraction analyses, and the application of a sequential Ba extraction method of selected samples. Additionally, we analyzed down-core samples of the planktonic foraminifera Turborotalita quinqueloba and Globorotalia inflata for their Ba/Ca ratios. These analyses, which were performed for the first time on these species, were used to reconstruct past oceanic Ba concentrations. We suggest that in the study area, which is characterized by high accumulation rates, the preserved TOC content is a valuable proxy for past primary productivity, whereas the solid phase Batot contents appear to be affected by other mechanisms and factors. Peaks of total barium content in the clay fraction and of Ba/Ca ratios in the planktonic foraminifera shells found during the Younger Dryas and the Heinrich 1 event are likely to result from increased meltwater influx into the northern North Atlantic. We suggest that Ba-enriched meltwater was transmitted by the eastern boundary current system from higher latitudes to the region of the Canary Islands. Total barium contents of the clay fraction (Batot,clay) and Ba/Ca in planktonic foraminifera shells seem to be reliable proxies for this discharge of meltwater.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic Boundary event at 252.2 Ma marks the largest extinction of marine fauna in the Phanerozoic and there is a wide consensus that the extinction coincided with an intense oceanic anoxic event. The stratotype of the Changhsingian Stage, precisely constrained by the PTB Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) and the GSSP for the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian Boundary, both at Meishan in southern China, is well-documented in respect to geochronology and the pattern of extinction. Here we report secular trends in bulk isotopic parameters and lipid biomarkers in a core spanning 214 m of stratigraphic section across the PTB and through the entire Changhsingian interval. Our analysis of these data, viewed in the context of relative sea level change and strontium isotopes, reveals distinct shifts in paleoenvironmental conditions and profound changes in plankton ecology well before and following the biological extinction event. Specifically, patterns of steroids and triterpenoids indicate a marine plankton community that was heavily dominated by bacteria during the late Wuchiapingian, middle Changhsingian and early Griesbachian stages. Secular trends in aromatic hydrocarbons diagnostic for anoxygenic green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) identify periods when euxinic conditions extended into the photic zone during the entire Changhsingian stage. Here also, the [delta]15N of organic nitrogen progressively shifted from positive values around + 2 or + 3[per mille sign] to - 1[per mille sign] coincident with a sharp negative excursion in [delta]13Corg and slightly postdating the sharp minimum in [delta]13C values of inorganic carbon that occurs at the top of Bed 24. These results, together the published chronology indicate that conditions unfavourable for aerobiosis existed in the marine photic zone at Meishan for 1.5 million years prior to the main phase of the biological extinction. The induction of marine euxinic conditions, worldwide, at the end of the Permian was likely a consequence of the aggregation of Pangea and the uplift, weathering and transport of nutrients to the ocean well in advance of the PTB. The protracted and widespread nature of the ensuing oceanic anoxic event suggests a causal association with the mass extinction.},

abstract = {A detailed study of size distributions of framboidal pyrite in Holocene Black Sea sediments establishes the timing of a change from deposition under an oxic water column to deposition under an anoxic and sulfidic water column. In the most recent carbonate-rich sediments (Unit I) and in the organic carbon-rich sapropel (Unit II), framboid size distributions are remarkably uniform (mean diameter = 5 $\mu$m); over 95{\%} of the framboids in Unit I and Unit II are {\textless} 7 $\mu$m in diameter. These properties of framboidal pyrite are consistent with framboid nucleation and growth within an anoxic and sulfidic water column, followed by transport to the sediment-water interface, cessation of pyrite growth due to the exhaustion of reactive iron, and subsequent burial. In contrast, the organic carbon-poor sediments of lacustrine Unit III contain pyrite framboids that are generally much larger in size (mean diameter = 10 $\mu$m). In Unit III, over 95{\%} of the framboids are {\textless} 25 $\mu$m in diameter, 40{\%} of framboids are between 7 $\mu$m and 25 $\mu$m, and framboids up to 50 $\mu$m in diameter are present. This distribution of sizes suggests framboid nucleation and growth within anoxic sediment porewaters. These new data on size distributions of framboidal pyrite confirm that the development of water-column anoxia in the Black Sea coincided with the initiation of deposition of laminated Unit II sapropels.},

abstract = {A simple model of the CaCO (sub 3) saturation state of the ocean is presented. It can be solved analytically and is intended to identify the fundamental controls on ocean carbonate ion concentration. It should also attract researchers unfamiliar with complex biogeochemical models. Despite its limitations, the model-calculated CaCO (sub 3) saturation state of today's ocean agrees well with observations. In general, the model reveals three distinctly different modes of operation: The "Strangelove Ocean" of high supersaturation which is dominated by inorganic CaCO (sub 3) precipitation, (2) the "Neritan Ocean" of indefinite saturation dominated by biogenic shallow-water CaCO (sub 3) precipitation, and (3) the "Cretan Ocean" of low saturation dominated by biogenic pelagic CaCO (sub 3) precipitation. In the latter mode, the deep ocean [CO (sub 3) (super 2-) ] is remarkably stable, provided that the biogenic production of CaCO (sub 3) exceeds the riverine flux of Ca (super 2+) and CO (sub 3) (super 2-) . This explains the overall constancy of the saturation state of the ocean documented over the last 100 Ma. The model is then used to address diverse questions. One important result is that the recovery of the oceanic carbonate chemistry from fossil fuel neutralization in the future will be accelerated due to expected reduced biogenic calcification.},

abstract = {Many negative $\delta$(13)C excursions in marine carbonates from the geological record are interpreted to record significant biogeochemical events in early Earth history. The assumption that no post-depositional processes can simultaneously alter carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C values towards more negative values is the cornerstone of this approach. However, the effects of post-depositional alteration on the relationship between carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C values have not been directly evaluated. Here we present paired carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C records that exhibit a coupled negative excursion resulting from multiple periods of meteoric alteration of the carbonate $\delta$(13)C record, and consequent contributions of isotopically negative terrestrial organic matter to the sedimentary record. The possibility that carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C records can be simultaneously shifted towards lower $\delta$(13)C values during periods of subaerial exposure may necessitate the reappraisal of some of the $\delta$(13)C anomalies associated with noteworthy biogeochemical events throughout Earth history.},

abstract = {Radium and barium uptake onto ferrihydrite and goethite have been studied in the concentration range 1nM to 5mM and from pH 4 to 10, to develop a model to predict radium behaviour in legacy uranium mining wastes. For ferrihydrite, uptake of Ra2+ at nM concentrations was strong at pH {\textgreater} 7. At higher concentrations, Ba2+ sorption to ferrihydrite was slightly weaker than that of Ra2+. Experiments with goethite showed weaker binding for both metal ions in all systems. The interactions of radium with both ferrihydrite and goethite are fully reversible. The behaviour of radium during transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite has been studied, and no evidence for irreversible incorporation within the goethite lattice was found; radium uptake to goethite was the same, whether or not it was present during its formation. Calcium competed with radium for ferrihydrite sorption only at high calcium concentrations ({\textgreater}10mM). Barium is a more effective competitor, and a concentration of 1mM reduced radium sorption. Sediment samples from a legacy uranium mining site have been analysed, and the in situ Rd values are consistent with radium uptake by surface coatings of ferrihydrite or goethite like phases. Surface complexation models have been developed for radium sorption to ferrihydrite and goethite which simulate the experimental data successfully. In both cases, approaches based on a single surface functional group and tetradentate binding sites simulated the data successfully. These data could be used in underpinning the safety case for legacy mining sites.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction, the most severe biotic crisis in the Phanerozoic, was accompanied by climate change and expansion of oceanic anoxic zones. The partitioning of sulfur among different exogenic reservoirs by biological and physical processes was of importance for this biodiversity crisis, but the exact role of bioessential sulfur in the mass extinction is still unclear. Here we show that globally increased production of organic matter affected the seawater sulfate sulfur and oxygen isotope signature that has been recorded in carbonate rock spanning the Permian−Triassic boundary. A bifurcating temporal trend is observed for the strata spanning the marine mass extinction with carbonate-associated sulfate sulfur and oxygen isotope excursions toward decreased and increased values, respectively. By coupling these results to a box model, we show that increased marine productivity and successive enhanced microbial sulfate reduction is the most likely scenario to explain these temporal trends. The new data demonstrate that worldwide expansion of euxinic and anoxic zones are symptoms of increased biological carbon recycling in the marine realm initiated by global warming. The spatial distribution of sulfidic water column conditions in shallow seafloor environments is dictated by the severity and geographic patterns of nutrient fluxes and serves as an adequate model to explain the scale of the marine biodiversity crisis. Our results provide evidence that the major biodiversity crises in Earth's history do not necessarily implicate an ocean stripped of (most) life but rather the demise of certain eukaryotic organisms, leading to a decline in species richness.},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotopic compositions of C15+ saturate and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions from 514 crude oils from known source rocks were examined for secular, episodic variations. The oils have been correlated by means of biomarker analyses and/or geological inferences to their respective source rocks and were further categorized into seven source rock types based on geochemical and petrologic indicators of depositional environments. Thus, these oil samples represent a wide range of source paleoenvironments from thirteen age divisions (Riphean to Neogene). The stable carbon isotopic compositions of both fractions become enriched in 13C with decreasing geologic age. Three major, abrupt shifts toward 13C enrichment occurred at the Precambrian-Cambrian/Ordovician, Triassic/Jurassic and Paleogene/neogene boundaries. Analysis of smaller scale isotopic shifts reveals four distinct groups of oils, generally independent of organic facies and secondary alteration processes. Comparison of evolutionary changes in the biosphere to episodic changes in stable carbon isotopic compositions throughout the Phanerozoic indicates that isotopic shifts of crude oils may generally be related to the diversity of preserved phytoplankton.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Early Earth processes are typically identified through the study of mineralogical, elemental and isotopic features in the rock record, including Precambrian banded iron formations (BIF). However, post-depositional processes often obscure the primary geochemical signals, making the use of BIF as proxies for paleo-seawater and the paleo-biosphere potentially imprecise. Thus, alternative approaches are required to complement the information gained from the rock record in order to fully understand the distinctive biogeochemical processes on ancient Earth. Simulating these conditions in the laboratory is one approach, but this approach can never fully replicate the complexity of a natural environment. Therefore, finding modern environments with a unique set of geochemical and microbiological characteristics to use as analogues for BIF depositional environments can provide invaluable information. In this review, we provide an overview of the chemical, physical and biological parameters of modern, ferruginous lakes that have been used as analogue BIF environments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The current distributions of widespread groups of terrestrial animals and plants are supposedly the result of a mixture of either vicariance owing to continental split or more recent trans-oceanic dispersal. For organisms exhibiting a vicariant biogeographic pattern-achieving their current distribution by riding on the plates of former supercontinents-this view is largely inspired by the belief that Pangaea lacked geographical or ecological barriers, or that extinctions and dispersal would have erased any biogeographic signal since the early Mesozoic. We here present a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of Onychophora (velvet worms), an ancient and exclusively terrestrial panarthropod group distributed throughout former Pangaean landmasses. Our data not only demonstrate that trans-oceanic dispersal does not need be invoked to explain contemporary distributions, but also reveal that the early diversification of the group pre-dates the break-up of Pangaea, maintaining regionalization even in landmasses that have remained contiguous throughout the history of the group. These results corroborate a growing body of evidence from palaeontology, palaeogeography and palaeoclimatic modelling depicting ancient biogeographic regionalization over the continuous landmass of Pangaea.},

abstract = {Basal Triassic carbonates of the Gerennav{\'{a}}r Formation (B{\"{u}}kk Mountains, Northern Hungary) were studied. The succession was deposited in an open marine deep ramp environment of the western Tethys, and can be divided into three parts on the basis of the dominant microfacies. The lowermost 0.5 m-thick interval is made up by thin-bedded and bioturbated mudstones which contain ostracods and Earlandia along with relict skeletal fragments. The successive 8 m-thick deposits consist of planar stromatolites with well-preserved microfabrics. The most characteristic microfabric elements are sphere clusters in a dense micrite groundmass, bushy aggregates of micrite clots, bundles of prostrate micrite threads, and peloids. The formation of the spheres and the surrounding dense micrite is attributed to calcification of a coccoid-cyanobacteria dominated mat community. The tufted micrite clot clusters crudely resemble Angusticellularia. A filamentous microbial origin is likely for the thread bundles. The peloids are interpreted either as reworked pieces of calcified mat, or rolled microbial clumps. The reduced preservation of microfabric components in the upper unit refers to less favourable condition for mat development which is probable due to deepening of the depositional environment. The overlying mudstone unit is very poor in fossils. The preservation of microbial microfabrics in the stromatolites indicates that early lithification by carbonate precipitation was widespread and intense even in open marine environments following the end-Permian boundary events. This supports the assumption that significant changes took place in geochemistry of seawater during the Late Permian-Early Triassic time interval. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Geochemical analyses of extraordinarily well preserved late Aptian–early Albian foraminifera from Blake Nose (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1049) reveal rapid shifts of $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C, and 87Sr/88Sr in the subtropical North Atlantic that may be linked to a major planktic foraminifer extinction event across the Aptian/Albian boundary. The abruptness of the observed geochemical shifts and their coincidence with a sharp lithologic contact is explained as an artifact of a previously undetected hiatus of 0.8–1.4 million years at the boundary contact, but the values before and after the hiatus indicate that major oceanographic changes occurred at this time. 87Sr/88Sr increase by {\~{}}0.000 200, $\delta$13C values decrease by 1.5‰ to 2.2‰, and $\delta$18O values decrease by {\~{}}1.0‰ (planktics) to 0.5‰ (benthics) across the hiatus. Further, both 87Sr/88Sr ratios and $\delta$18O values during the Albian are anomalously high. The 87Sr/88Sr values deviate from known patterns to such a degree that an explanation requires either the presence of inter-basin differences in seawater 87Sr/88Sr during the Albian or revision of the seawater curve. For $\delta$18O, planktic values in some Aptian samples likely reflect a diagenetic overprint, but preservation is excellent in the rest of the section. In well preserved material, benthic foraminiferal values are largely between 0.5 and 0.0‰ and planktic samples are largely between 0.0‰ to −1.0‰, with a brief excursion to −2.0‰ during OAE 1b. Using standard assumptions for Cretaceous isotopic paleotemperature calculations, the $\delta$18O values suggest bottom water temperatures (at {\~{}}1000 –1500 m) of 8–10°C and surface temperatures of 10–14°C, which are 4–6°C and 10–16°C cooler, respectively, than present-day conditions at the same latitude. The cool subtropical sea surface temperature estimates are especially problematic because other paleoclimate proxy data for the mid-Cretaceous and climate model predictions suggest that subtropical sea surface temperatures should have been the same as or warmer than at present. Because of their exquisite preservation, whole scale alteration of the analyzed foraminifera is an untenable explanation. Our proposed solution is a high evaporative fractionation factor in the early Albian North Atlantic that resulted in surface waters with higher $\delta$18O values at elevated salinities than commonly cited in Cretaceous studies. A high fractionation factor is consistent with high rates of vapor export and a vigorous hydrological cycle and, like the Sr isotopes, implies limited connectivity among the individual basins of the Early Cretaceous proto-Atlantic ocean. },

Over 90{\%} of marine species were eliminated1,2, causing the destruction of the marine ecosystem structure3. This biotic crisis is generally interpreted as a single extinction event around 252.3 million years ago2,4–6, and has been variously attributed to the eruption of the Siberian Traps or possibly a bolide impact7–10. Here we demonstrate that the marine extinction consisted of two pulses, separated by a 180,000-year recovery phase. We evaluated the range of 537 species representing 17 marine groups in seven Chinese sections froma 450,000-year interval spanning the Permian–Triassic boundary. The first stage of extinction occurred during the latest Permian, and was marked by the extinction of 57{\%} of species, namely all plankton and some benthic groups, including algae, rugose corals, and fusulinids. The second phase occurred in the earliest Triassic, and resulted in the extinction of 71{\%} of the remaining species. This second extinction phase fundamentally altered the marine ecosystem structure that had existed for the previous 200 million years. Because the two pulses showed different extinction selectivity,we conclude that theymay have had different environmental causes.},

The compiled $\delta$44/40CaSW record shows a general increase from ∼1.3‰ (NIST SRM 915a) at the beginning of the Ordovician to ∼2‰ at present. Superimposed on this trend is a major long-term positive excursion from the Early Carboniferous to Early Permian as well as several short-term, mostly negative, oscillations. A numerical model of the global cycles of calcium, carbon, magnesium and strontium was used to estimate whether the recorded $\delta$44/40CaSW variations can be explained by varying magnitudes of input and output fluxes of calcium to the oceans. The model uses the record of marine 87Sr/86Sr ratios as proxy for seafloor spreading rates, a record of oceanic Mg/Ca ratios to estimate rates of dolomite formation, and reconstructed atmospheric CO2, discharge and erosion rates to estimate continental weathering fluxes. The model results indicate that varying magnitudes of the calcium input and output fluxes cannot explain the observed $\delta$44/40CaSW trends, suggesting that the isotope signatures of these fluxes must also have changed. As a possible mechanism we suggest variable isotope fractionation in the sedimentary output flux controlled by the dominant mineralogy in marine carbonate deposits, i.e. the oscillating ‘calcite–aragonite seas'. The ultimate control of the calcium isotope budget of the Phanerozoic oceans appears to have been tectonic processes, specifically variable rates of oceanic crust production that modulated the hydrothermal calcium flux and the oceanic Mg/Ca ratio, which in turn controlled the dominant mineralogy of marine carbonates, hence the $\delta$44/40CaSW. As to the causes of the short-term oscillations recorded in the secular $\delta$44/40CaSW trend, we tentatively propose that these are related to variable rates of dolomite formation and/or to changing chemical composition of the riverine flux, in particular Ca/HCO3- and Ca/SO42- ratios, induced by variable proportions of silicate vs. carbonate weathering rates on the continents.},

abstract = {When used in conjunction with trace metal redox proxies, the use of U/Mo ratios and ?? 95/95Mo values can considerably enhance the interpretation of ocean oxygenation trends both locally and globally. This is illustrated with studies from two, biogenic-chert dominated records of mass extinction: the Ordovician-Silurian boundary and the Late Permian in sections from the Yangtze Block in South China. The latest Ordovician mass extinction is well known to coincide with oxygenation episode in the Hirnantian Stage here revealed by trace metal proxies (V/V+Ni, V/Cr, Ni/Co) that show it sandwiched between anoxic/euxinic black shales. The predominantly anoxic/euxinic Ordovician-Silurian strata provide a record of seawater ?? 95/95Mo values that are seen to gradually rise during the interval from 0.5 to 1.0???. The exception to the ?? 98/95 Mo stability is the datum of the slight negatively ?? 98/95Mo, associated with decreasing of V/Cr and V/(V+Ni) ratio suggesting the Hirnantian oxygenation event. The Upper Permian chert succession at Shangsi reveals an overall better ventilated record in which the best oxygenated strata show the highest U/Mo values that is interpreted as relative enrichment of U in suboxic conditions. At a few levels anoxic/euxinic conditions show the ?? 95/95Mo values to be {\~{}}2???, close to modern values, implying that latest Permian oceans were as well ventilated as those today. The well-known end-Permian oceanic anoxic event is therefore suggested to only develop at the end of this period. ?? 2012.},

We use an earth system model to quantify the biogeochemical and physical conditions necessary for widespread oceanic euxinia and hydrogen sulfide release to the atmosphere. Greater than threefold increases in ocean nutrient content combined with nutrient-trapping ocean circulation cause surface-water H2S accumulation in the paleo–Tethys Ocean and in areas of strong upwelling. Accounting for the presence of sulfide-oxidizing phototrophs in the model suppresses but does not prevent widespread release of H2S to the atmosphere. Evidence from the geologic record is consistent with modeled geochemical distributions of widespread nutrient-induced euxinia during the end-Permian, suggesting H2S toxicity and hypercapnia may have provided the kill mechanism for extinction.},

Past theoretical models for predicting the tortuosity from porosity data do not work with marine muds, and scientists and engineers have had to resort to entirely empirical models, without a mechanistic explanation and with unknown predictive power. We offer the first geometric model for the dependence of tortuosity on porosity in marine muds; the model is based on the tortuosity of separated layers of nonoverlapping disks. The fitted geometric constant in this model indicates that natural marine sediments act as if their fabric were made of disks with thickness:diameter ratios very close to 1:2, which indicates a blocklike fabric with respect to diffusion. The model was also applied to predict the tortuosity of a variety of sediments and soils not in the original database, and it provides a satisfactory prediction of the mean trend in these data.},

abstract = {The concentrations of total carbonate (Ct), sulphate, sulphide, thiols and oxygen, the ratio between the stable sulphur isotopes 34S and 32S in sulphate and sulphide, and the density (used to calculate salinity) were determined on samples from the water column of Framvaren, a superanoxic fjord in southern Norway. From a depth of 18m (the oxic-anoxic boundary) the initial sulphate concentration, ([SO4]init), as calculated from salinity, is significantly higher than the sum of the measured sulphur species. This is attributed to a loss of sulphur from the water column. The amount of total carbonate produced, corrected for the initial concentration (Ct - 2.4 Sal/35) is found to be proportional to the amount of sulphate consumed, ([SO4]init - [SO4]), according to the following relation Ct - 2.4 Sal/35 = 1.84 ([SO4]init - [SO4]). Isotopic fractionation caused by bacterial sulphate reduction in the anoxic part of the water column produces sulphide with a $\delta$34S ∼ 40‰ lower than the $\delta$34S for sulphate at corresponding depths. The isotopic fractionation also results in $\delta$34S value for the remaining sulphate at depths below 80 m being considerably higher than the mean value for ocean water, which is close to + 20‰. The $\delta$34S values for sulphate at depths between 10 and 50 m were lower than + 20‰ which indicates oxidation of sulphide, which follows upon diffusion of sulphide from deeper parts of the water column and inflow of oxygenated seawater over the sill into the anoxic water of the fjord. A conclusive scenario of the Framvaren sulphur chemistry is presented.},

abstract = {Authigenic seafloor carbonate crusts include fenestrate microbialite, thrombolite, and four types here designated: Fine-grained Crust, Sparry Crust, Hybrid Sparry Fine-grained Crust, and Sparry Crust plus Coarse Grains. Each of the latter four types includes at least some layered examples that have generally been regarded as stromatolites. Recognition and interpretation of these various deposits assists understanding of stromatolite development. Sparry Crust is common in the Late Archaean-Mesoproterozoic. It includes botryoidal fans and other crystal pseudomorphs, microdigitate stromatolite, dendrite, isopachous laminite, and herringbone calcite. Although differing in primary mineralogy and bedform, these are all characterized by coarse sparry, commonly radial fi brous, fabric and appear light coloured in thin-section. They have commonly been referred to as seafl oor cement, although they formed at the open sediment-water interface rather than as void-fills. Two of them in particular, isopachous laminite and micro- digitate “tufa”, typically form isopachous layers with good vertical inheritance and have been regarded as stro- matolites. In contrast to Sparry Crust, Fine-grained Crust has fine-grained (micritic, clotted, peloidal, filamentous) microfabric that appears dark in thin-section, and irregular uneven layering with relatively poor inheritance. Mixed crusts, composed of millimetric alternations of Sparry and Fine-grained crust, are here termed Hybrid Sparry Fine- grained Crust. Sparry Crust with coarse allochthonous grains – here termed Sparry Crust plus Coarse Grains – includes some examples that have been given formal stromatolite names, e.g., Gongylina and Omachtenia. Sparry, Hybrid, and Fine-grained crusts are common components of Precambrian stromatolites. Their relative abun- dances change through time. Archaean stromatolite fabrics are commonly obscured by recrystallization, but their preserved lamina arrangements suggest that many of them could be composed mainly of Sparry or Hybrid crust. During the Palaeoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic, Sparry Crust fabrics were common in peritidal stromatolites, where- as Hybrid Crust appears to have dominated large subtidal domes and columns. Fine-grained Crust may not have become generally abundant until the Neoproterozoic, when it commonly formed both stromatolites and throm bolites. Phanerozoic normal marine stromatolites are also typically composed of Fine-grained Crust. Present-day analogues of Sparry Crust fabrics occur in some speleothem, hot spring, and splash-zone marine crusts, and of Fine-grained Crust in lithif ed microbial mats. Light-dark millimetric alternations of sparry and fi ne-grained crust that characterize Hybrid Crust have analogues in freshwater stromatolites. Taken together, these com parisons suggest that some Precambrian stromatolites are abiogenic, some microbial, and others are intimate hybrid mixtures of the two, and that – preservation permitting – these varieties can be distinguished using microfabric and lamina criteria.},

Methane has isotopic values ($\delta$13C) low enough to reduce to feasible amounts the carbon required for isotopic mass balance. The duration of the carbon isotopic excursions and inferred methane releases are here constrained to {\textless}10,000 yr by counting annual varves in lake deposits and by estimating peat accumulation rates. On paleogeographic maps, the most marked carbon isotope excursions form linear arrays back to plausible methane sources: end‐Permian Siberian Traps and Longwood‐Bluff intrusions of New Zealand and end‐Guadalupian Emeishan Traps of China. Intrusion of coal seams by feeder dikes to flood basalts could create successive thermogenic methane outbursts of the observed timing and magnitude, but these are unreasonably short times for replenishment of marine or permafrost sources of methane. Methane released by fracturing and heating of coal during intrusion of large igneous provinces may have been a planetary hazard comparable with bolide impact.},

abstract = {We present a revised approach for standardizing and reporting analyses of multiply substituted isotopologues of CO2 (i.e., ‘clumped' isotopic species, especially the mass-47 isotopologues). Our approach standardizes such data to an absolute reference frame based on theoretical predictions of the abundances of multiply-substituted isotopologues in gaseous CO2 at thermodynamic equilibrium. This reference frame is preferred over an inter-laboratory calibration of carbonates because it enables all laboratories measuring mass 47 CO2 to use a common scale that is tied directly to theoretical predictions of clumping in CO2, regardless of the laboratory's primary research field (carbonate thermometry or CO2 biogeochemistry); it explicitly accounts for mass spectrometric artifacts rather than convolving (and potentially confusing) them with chemical fractionations associated with sample preparation; and it is based on a thermodynamic equilibrium that can be experimentally established in any suitably equipped laboratory using commonly available materials. By analyzing CO2 gases that have been subjected to established laboratory procedures known to promote isotopic equilibrium (i.e., heated gases and water-equilibrated CO2), and by reference to thermodynamic predictions of equilibrium isotopic distributions, it is possible to construct an empirical transfer function that is applicable to data with unknown clumped isotope signatures. This transfer function empirically accounts for the fragmentation and recombination reactions that occur in electron impact ionization sources and other mass spectrometric artifacts. We describe the protocol necessary to construct such a reference frame, the method for converting gases with unknown clumped isotope compositions to this reference frame, and suggest a protocol for ensuring that all reported isotopic compositions (e.g., $\Delta$47 values; Eiler and Schauble, 2004 and Eiler, 2007) can be compared among different laboratories and instruments, independent of laboratory-specific analytical or methodological differences. We then discuss the use of intra-laboratory secondary reference frames (e.g., based on carbonate standards) that can be more easily used to track the evolution of each laboratory's empirical transfer function. Finally, we show inter-laboratory reproducibility on the order of ±0.010 (1$\sigma$) for four carbonate standards, and present revised paleotemperature scales that should be used to convert carbonate clumped isotope signatures to temperature when using the absolute reference frame described here. Even when using the reference frame, small discrepancies remain between two previously published synthetic carbonate calibrations. We discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies, and highlight the need for additional low temperature ({\textless}15 °C) synthetic carbonate experiments.},

abstract = {A variety of paleogeographic reconstructions have been published, with applications ranging from paleoclimate, ocean circulation and faunal radiation models to resource exploration; yet their uncertainties remain difficult to assess as they are generally presented as low-resolution static maps. We present a methodology for ground-truthing the digital Palaeogeographic Atlas of Australia by linking the GPlates plate reconstruction tool to the global Paleobiology Database and a Phanerozoic plate motion model. We develop a spatio-temporal data mining workflow to validate the Phanerozoic Palaeogeographic Atlas of Australia with paleoenvironments derived from fossil data. While there is general agreement between fossil data and the paleogeographic model, the methodology highlights key inconsistencies. The Early Devonian paleogeographic model of southeastern Australia insufficiently describes the Emsian inundation that may be refined using biofacies distributions. Additionally, the paleogeographic model and fossil data can be used to strengthen numerical models, such as the dynamic topography and the associated inundation of eastern Australia during the Cretaceous. Although paleobiology data provide constraints only for paleoenvironments with high preservation potential of organisms, our approach enables the use of additional proxy data to generate improved paleogeographic reconstructions.},

In particular, depletions of sulfur-34 (34S) in sulfide relative to sulfate exceeding 47 per mil (‰) often serve as a proxy for the disproportionation of intermediate sulfur species in addition to sulfate reduction. Here, we demonstrate that a pure, actively growing culture of a marine sulfate-reducing bacterium can deplete 34Sbyupto66‰during sulfate reduction alone and in the absence of an extracellular oxidative sulfur cycle. Therefore, similar magnitudes of sulfur isotope fractionation in sedimentary rocks do not unambiguously record the presence of other sulfur-based metabolisms or the stepwise oxygenation of Earth's surface environment during the Proterozoic.},

Based on images obtained by the Curiosity rover, we interpret these outcrops as evidence for past fluvial, deltaic, and lacustrine environments. Degradation of the crater wall and rim probably supplied these sediments, which advanced inward from the wall, infilling both the crater and an internal lake basin to a thickness of at least 75 meters. This intracrater lake system probably existed intermittently for thousands to millions of years, implying a relatively wet climate that supplied moisture to the crater rim and transported sediment via streams into the lake basin. The deposits in Gale crater were then exhumed, probably by wind-driven erosion, creating Aeolis Mons (Mount Sharp).},

abstract = {We determined the stable oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of live (Rose Bengal stained) benthic foraminifera ({\textgreater} 150 ??m size fraction) of seven taxa sampled along a downslope transect between 140 to 2000 m water depth in the Bay of Biscay. At the five stations, Hoeglundina elegans, Cibicidoides pachydermus, Uvigerina peregrina, Uvigerina mediterranea preferentially occupy shallow infaunal niches, whereas Melonis barleeanus and Uvigerina elongatastriata occupy an intermediate infaunal microhabitat, and Globobulimina spp. live in a deep infaunal niche close to the zero oxygen boundary. When compared with ??18O values of calcite formed in equilibrium with bottom waters, U. peregrina forms its test in close equilibrium with bottom water ??18O. All other foraminiferal taxa calcify with a constant offset to calculated equilibrium calcite. There is no systematic relationship between the foraminiferal microhabitat depth and the ????18O between foraminiferal and equilibrium calcite. We calculated correcting factors for the various taxa, which are needed for constructing multispecies-based oxygen isotope records in paleoceanographic studies of the study area. The ??13C values of foraminiferal taxa investigated in this study do neither record bottom water ??13CDIC in a 1: 1 relationship nor with a constant offset, but appear to be mainly controlled by microhabitat effects. The increase of ??13C values of shallow infaunal taxa with increasing water depth reflects the decrease of the exported flux of organic carbon along the bathymetric transect and early diagenetic processes in the surface sediment. This is particularly the case for the shallow infaunal U. peregrina. The ??13C values of deep infaunal Globobulimina spp. are much less dependent on the exported organic matter flux. We suggest that the ????13C between U. peregrina and Globobulimina spp. can shed light on the various pathways of past degradation of organic detritus in the benthic environments. At a station in 550 m water depth, where periodic eutrophication of sediment surface niches was demonstrated previously, we performed a two-year seasonal survey of the isotopic composition of foraminiferal faunas. No marked seasonal changes of the stable carbon isotopic composition of shallow, intermediate and deep infaunal foraminiferal taxa were observed. Thus, the ??13C values of foraminiferal individuals belonging to the {\textgreater} 150 ??m fraction may result from rather long-term calcification processes lasting for several weeks or months, which limit the impact of ephemeral 12C enrichment of shallow infaunal niches on the isotope chemistry of adult individuals during eutrophic periods. Only highly opportunistic taxa reproducing or calcifying during phytoplankton bloom periods and the subsequent deposits of phytoplankton remains in the benthic environment may exhibit a particularly low ??13C, indicative of such short productive periods. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition is marked by distinct perturbations in the global carbon cycle resulting in a prominent negative carbon-isotope excursion at the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary, well known from a plethora of marine and continental sediments. Potential causes for this negative delta(13)C trend (and their links to the latest Permian mass extinction) have been intensively debated in the literature. In order to draw conclusions regarding causation, a general delta(13)C curve was defined after consideration of all available datasets and with due reference to the biostratigraphic background. The most important features of the P-T carbon-isotope trend are the following: the 4-7 parts per thousand delta(13)C decline (lasting similar to 500,000 years) is gradual and began in the Changhsingian at the stratigraphic level of the C. bachmanni Zone. The decreasing trend is interrupted by a short-term positive event that starts at about the latest Permian low-latitude marine main extinction event horizon (=EH), indicating that the extinction itself cannot have caused the negative carbon-isotope excursion. After this short-term positive excursion, the delta(13)C decline continues to a first minimum at about the P-T boundary. A subsequent slight increase is followed by a second (occasionally two-peaked) minimum in the lower (and middle) I. isarcica Zone. The negative carbon-isotope excursion was most likely a consequence of a combination of different causes that may include: (1) direct and indirect effects of the Siberian Trap and contemporaneous volcanism and (2) anoxic deep waters occasionally reaching very shallow sea levels. A sudden release of isotopically light methane from oceanic sediment piles or permafrost soils as a source for the negative carbon-isotope trend is questionable at least for the time span a little below the EH and somewhat above the P-T boundary.

abstract = {Thermally unaltered conodont elements, brachiopods, and vertebrates were analyzed with reverse phase high profile liquid chromatography to locate and quantify amino acid remnants of the original organic matrix in the fossils. No consistent similarities in amino acid content were found in conodont taxa, and criteria based on organic residues appear to have no taxonomic significance in the fossils tested from these localities. However, hydroxyproline, an amino acid that is found in the collagen molecules of animals, as well as in the glycoproteins in the cell walls and reproductive tissues of certain plants, is represented in most taxa. The organic matter retained in the impermeable crowns of conodont elements might have been derived originally from a form of collagen. Biochemical analyses, correlated with histochemical tests, demonstrate that organic matter is an integral part of the hyaline tissue of the element crown and not the result of surface contamination. Tests of a range of vertebrate and invertebrate fossil hard tissues produced similar results. The analyses indicate that hyaline tissue in the conodont element crown is not a form of vertebrate enamel, which contains no collagen. Albid tissue, with little or no organic content, is not a form of vertebrate bone or dentine, both based on collagen and low in mineral. Although these results do not help to determine the phylogenetic affinities of conodont animals, they indicate that conodont elements do not contain hard tissues characteristic of vertebrate animals.},

Our carbon isotopic measurements of bulk carbonate and organic matter from the Meishan section, South China show that a -3{\%} shift of $\delta$13C spanned 30 ka over the end-Permian mass extinction. Carbon isotopic excursions ($\delta$13Ccarb, $\delta$13Corg) coupled with $\Delta$13C (=$\delta$13Ccarb-$\delta$13Corg), marine kerogen {\%}, 87Sr/86Sr of siliciclastics and total organic carbon show geochemical signals underwent six geochemical variation zones (GVZ) over the P/Tr transition. Of these, GVZ 1 corresponds to the lower-middle parts of Bed 24e-1, GVZ 2 to the upper part of Bed 24e-1, GVZ 3 to Beds 24e-2, 24e-3, 25-2 and 25-2, GVZ 4 to Bed 25-3, GVZ 5 to Bed 26, and GVZ 6 to Beds 27-29. A-1{\%}shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka before the main extinction was probably generated by possible dissociation of methane hydrate by warming. Subsequent mixing of anoxic stratified ocean led to another-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 5 ka during the extinction. The-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka after the main extinction has probably resulted from massive denudation of soil and sediments caused by the collapse of forests and possible dissociation of methane hydrate at the end of the Permian. Furthermore, a dramatic drop of $\Delta$13C values from 29-30{\%} in Bed 24e-3 to 25{\%} in Bed 25 indicates an abrupt proliferation of phototrophic sulfur bacteria immediately after the main episode of the end-Permian mass extinction. The $\Delta$13C value increases to 29-30{\%} in Bed 26 again, and this is probably due to massive denudation of soil and sediment caused by the collapse of forests between 0 and 27 ka after the main extinction, as revealed by negative shift of $\delta$13C. Low $\Delta$13C value recorded in Beds 27-29 indicates that phototrophic sulfur bacteria may have thrived again and lasted more than 150 ka after the main extinction in the low-latitude Paleo-Tethys. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {A 1 m thick carbonate crust, layered and commonly domal, caps crinoidal limestones on reef complexes of the top Permian Changxing Formation in the Huaying Mountains, eastern Sichuan, China. The crust's stratigraphic level lies at a sharp change in facies, and is overlain by poorly fossiliferous laminated micrites and shales of the Lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation. The crust therefore appears to coincide with the end-Permian extinction event, although the dating of the strata is currently imprecise. The crust is composed mostly of digitate carbonate, locally thrombolitic, with remnant lobate fabric, and resembles microbialites, but is mostly recrystallised and a microbial origin is unconfirmed. It is enclosed in micrite with pyrite crystals, ostracode and other shell debris. The crust is absent from interreef areas. Previous interpretations of karstification and calcrete formation are not upheld, and the facies were deposited under water. Overlying sediments are low energy, with abundant ferroan calcite and pyrite, reflecting anoxia associated with rising sea level. Various interpretations of the crust are possible: (1) it was organic, and microbia grew preferentially on topographic highs of reef tops; (2) microbia were a disaster biota in the absence of grazers; (3) microbia took advantage of favourable conditions for calcification, associated with a rapidly rising environmental-CO2 content during the Late Permian; (4) the crust was an inorganic precipitate associated with CO2-rich water. Microbial crusts are rare after the Cambrian, but whether this crust is organic or not, its presence in these strata reinforces the view that oceanic-atmospheric conditions in the Permian-Triassic boundary interval were unusual.},

abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth's biota is entering a sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the “background” rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

abstract = {Stromatolites may be Earth's oldest macroscopic fossils; however, it remains controversial what, if any, biological processes are recorded in their morphology. Although the biological interpretation of many stromatolite morphologies is confounded by the influence of sedimentation, conical stromatolites form in the absence of sedimentation and are, therefore, considered to be the most robust records of biophysical processes. A qualitative similarity between conical stromatolites and some modern microbial mats suggests a photosynthetic origin for ancient stromatolites. To better understand and interpret ancient fossils, we seek a quantitative relationship between the geometry of conical stromatolites and the biophysical processes that control their growth. We note that all modern conical stromatolites and many that formed in the last 2.8 billion years display a characteristic centimeter-scale spacing between neighboring structures. To understand this prominent-but hitherto uninterpreted-organization, we consider the role of diffusion in mediating competition between stromatolites. Having confirmed this model through laboratory experiments and field observation, we find that organization of a field of stromatolites is set by a diffusive time scale over which individual structures compete for nutrients, thus linking form to physiology. The centimeter-scale spacing between modern and ancient stromatolites corresponds to a rhythmically fluctuating metabolism with a period of approximately 20 hr. The correspondence between the observed spacing and the day length provides quantitative support for the photosynthetic origin of conical stromatolites throughout geologic time.},

abstract = {In this study the sulfur cycle in the organic-rich mud belt underlying the highly productive upwelling waters of the Namibian shelf is quantified using a 1D reaction-transport model. The model calculates vertical concentration and reaction rate profiles in the top 500 cm of sediment which are compared to a comprehensive dataset which includes carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and iron compounds as well as sulfate reduction (SR) rates and stable sulfur isotopes (32S, 34S). The sulfur dynamics in the well-mixed surface sediments are strongly influenced by the activity of the large sulfur bacteria Thiomargarita namibiensis which oxidize sulfide (H2S) to sulfate (SO42 -) using sea water nitrate (NO3-) as the terminal electron acceptor. Microbial sulfide oxidation (SOx) is highly efficient, and the model predicts intense cycling between SO42 - and H2S driven by coupled SR and SOx at rates exceeding 6.0 mol S m-2 y-1. More than 96{\%} of the SR is supported by SOx, and only 2-3{\%} of the SO42 - pool diffuses directly into the sediment from the sea water. A fraction of the SO42 - produced by Thiomargarita is drawn down deeper into the sediment where it is used to oxidize methane anaerobically, thus preventing high methane concentrations close to the sediment surface. Only a small fraction of total H2S production is trapped as sedimentary sulfide, mainly pyrite (FeS2) and organic sulfur (Sorg) (∼0.3 wt.{\%}), with a sulfur burial efficiency which is amongst the lowest values reported for marine sediments ({\textless}1{\%}). Yet, despite intense SR, FeS2 and Sorg show an isotope composition of ∼5 ‰ at 500 cm depth. These heavy values were simulated by assuming that a fraction of the solid phase sulfur exchanges isotopes with the dissolved sulfide pool. An enrichment in H2S of 34S towards the sediment-water interface suggests that Thiomargarita preferentially remove H232S from the pore water. A fractionation of 20-30‰ was estimated for SOx ($\epsilon$SOx) with the model, along with a maximum fractionation for SR ($\epsilon$SR-max) of 100‰. These values are far higher than previous laboratory-based estimates for these processes. Mass balance calculations indicate negligible disproportionation of autochthonous elemental sulfur; an explanation routinely cited in the literature to account for the large fractionations in SR. Instead, the model indicates that repeated multi-stepped sulfide oxidation and intracellular disproportionation by Thiomargarita could, in principle, allow the measured isotope data to be simulated using much lower fractionations for $\epsilon$SOx (5‰) and $\epsilon$SR (78‰). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Donoghue1998,
abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of conodont palaeobiology and functional morphology have rendered established hypotheses of element growth untenable. In order to address this problem, hard tissue histology is reviewed paying particular attention to the relationships during growth of the component hard tissues comprising conodont elements, and ignoring a priori assumptions of the homologies of these tissues. Conodont element growth is considered further in terms of the pattern of formation, of which four distinct types are described, all possibly derived from a primitive condition after heterochronic changes in the timing of various developmental stages. It is hoped that this may provide further means of unravelling conodont phylogeny. The manner in which the tissues grew is considered homologous with other vertebrate hard tissues, and the elements appear to have grown in a way similar to the growing scales and growing dentition of other vertebrates.},
